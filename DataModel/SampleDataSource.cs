                    "Early life:\n     The infant Kal-El was sent to Earth by his parents, Jor-El and Lara, prior to the destruction of their home planet Krypton. Kal-El's capsule landed near Smallville, Kansas where he was found by Jonathan and Martha Kent and subsequently took a liking to both of them. The Kents adopted the young Kryptonian, naming him Clark.\n     Clark began to discover his powers while growing up in Smallville, and was sometimes frustrated by his need to hide them from the public. His parents revealed to him the spaceship, as well as a hologram, that arrived with him when he first came to Earth. Clark was told of the destruction of his planet and briefly met his real mother and father.\n\nHero of Metropolis:\n     As an adult, Clark moved to Metropolis and found employment as a reporter for the Daily Planet. In keeping with his civilian identity of Clark Kent, Superman maintained a high rise apartment and automobile of his own. Additionally, Clark Kent often ate even though Superman received his sustenance from the yellow sun, and did not require food. \n     An early appearance in costume, saving a young girl, attracted the attention of Lois Lane  as the story replaced one of her own. It was Lois who subsequently gave Clark's costumed persona the name Superman. \n     Shortly after his arrival in Metropolis, Superman met Lex Luthor, who would become one of his greatest and most persistent adversaries, and defeated terrorist John Corben. In the following months, a variety of costumed criminals  some with metahuman abilities  began to appear in Metropolis to oppose the Man of Steel. A by-no-means complete list would include the Toyman, the Parasite, Livewire, Corben as Metallo, Bizarro, Volcana, andLuminus..\n     Even as his roster of enemies continued to swell, Superman would also encounter many individuals whom he would come to consider staunch allies: the Flash, Batman, Dr. Fate, Steel, Aquaman, Robin, and the Green Lantern Kyle Rayner. He also discovered, on Krypton's sister world Argo, a young woman who would become not only a loyal ally but also a new (if adoptive) family member: Supergirl.\n\nProtector of Earth and other worlds:\n     After responding to the Imperium invasion, Superman joined with Batman, Green Lantern, Flash, Wonder Woman,Hawkgirl, and J'onn J'onzz to form the Justice League.During this time, Superman and the Justice League would have many adventures, such as defeating Mongul on War World and exposing Lex Luthor as a criminal. Two of the more significant adventures for Superman would involve meeting an alternate universe team of the Justice League called theJustice Lords and face off once more against Darkseid and Brainiac, who were seemingly destroyed by Superman.\n\nPowers and abilities:\n     Superman possessed the powers of vast superhuman strength and speed, near-invulnerability, flight, super breath, heat vision, x-ray vision, telescopic/microscopic vision, super hearing, and a computer-like mind. Lana Lang referred to him as a boy genius.\n\nWeaknesses:\n     Superman derived his power from the yellow sun of Earth. Forced under a red sun akin to that of his homeworld of Krypton, Superman rapidly lost his powers, reverting to the stature of a normal human. Artificially-created red sun radiation had the same effect although depending on the amount, it can do anything from either completely depriving Superman of his powers or just weakening him.\n     Aside from red sun radiation, Superman's main weakness was Kryptonite, radioactive shards of his destroyed home planet. Exposure to Kryptonite would rob Superman of his power and cause him great pain, and prolonged exposure could kill him.\n     Superman's only other known weaknesses were magic and power draining, which could injure him as easily as it can any other being. In fact, Superman seemed even more vulnerable to magic than an average human.In addition, Superman would display an intolerance to electricity-based attacks but this would vary depending on opponents and given circumstances.",

                    "Early life:\n     Bruce Wayne was born to the wealthy Wayne family, the son of Thomas and Martha Wayne. On the way home from seeing the film The Mark of Zorro, Bruce watched as his parents were gunned down by a mugger.Some say that Bruce died that night with his parents, and in his place, Batman was born. Batman later told Wonder Woman that he hadn't been a kid since that day. Young Master Bruce was taken home to Wayne Manor, where he was raised by the Waynes' faithful guardian and butler, Alfred Pennyworth.\n     Bruce learned many arts and sciences with the goal of eliminating the crime that took his parents from him. He learned from masters in their fields, such as escape artistry from Zatara, martial arts from Yoru Sensei in Japan and The Master in Nanda Parbat, and science from Nobel laureates.\n     While Bruce trained with Zatara, he and his mentor's daughter Zatanna became very close. When she was framed for a robbery, Batman helped clear her name, and the two would later work together in the Justice League.\n     Bruce very nearly gave up his plan to become a force for justice in the night when he nearly found happiness with Andrea Beaumont. When Andrea walked out of his life, he became even more determined and dove headfirst onto the path of becoming Batman.\n     One day while Bruce was exploring the recently discovered bat-infested caverns below Wayne Manor, Alfred informed him that Andrea would be leaving both he and Gotham behind. Recalling the omen of bats bursting from the belly of the caverns, when he decided to give up his life as a crimefighter to be with Andrea, Bruce set up an appropriate identity to strike fear into the hearts of superstitious and cowardly criminals. He donned a suit made to look like a giant bat and built his secret headquarters, the Batcave, in the caverns below the Manor.\n     Eventually, Bruce took in Dick Grayson as his ward after Dick's parents were killed. He eventually took Dick as his partner, Robin.\n     Batman spent years keeping the people of Gotham City safe from common criminals and bizarre villains. He had several partners and occasional imitators, such as Batwoman,but his most common partner was Barbara Gordon, who had officially taken the job at his side as Batgirl. While on another mission, Batman would rescue the young Tim Drake from Two-Face, who had made an attempt to kill the boy. The young boy found himself inspired by Bruce's desire to stand up to people like Two-Face. In combination with his own rebellious nature, Tim would unwittingly steal the Robin costume from the Batcave and take up the mantle as the second Robin. Receiving Tim as his new sidekick, Batman gave the young boy three rules: Tim had to give Bruce everything he's got, Tim had to give him more, and Bruce makes the rules.\n\nSaving the world:\n     Batman invited the other six heroes who had repelled the invaders to the station and saved the earth. With this, the seven heroes formed the Justice League. Claiming he wasn't a people person, Batman did not officially join the League, though he did offer to be on call when the League needed his help.\n     Batman was quick to place himself in danger, despite the awe-inspiring powers of his teammates. During the Atlantis usurpation, Batman put a stop to the melting of the polar ice caps.On another occasion, Batman single-handedly defeated five dangerous criminals before being surprised by an Amazon-trained criminal while managing to take her necklace as a clue to her identity.\n     During the Thanagarian invasion of Earth, Batman was forced to reveal his identity to his teammates and provide the Batcave as a temporary meeting place and battleground when the Thanagarians tried to take them down. After successfully retaking the Watchtower from Thanagarian forces, Batman piloted the Watchtower through the Earth's atmosphere in an attempt to plunge it into a Hyperspace Bypass, a city-wide machine that would generate a wormhole through Earth. .\n     With the Watchtower's destruction and Hawkgirl's resignation from the League, Batman and the five other members reformed the Justice League with a new Watchtower and an expanded roster of heroes. Batman was instrumental in recruiting Green Arrow who, along with other human Justice League members, helped keep the League from becoming an autonomous metahuman army. He also succeeded in demonstrating to Amanda Waller that Cadmus was being used as a tool to further Lex Luthor's personal agenda to discredit and destroy the Justice League.\n     Waller was so impressed with Batman that she created Project Batman Beyond to ensure that the world would always have a Batman.\n\nPowers and abilities:\n     Batman, though considered a superhero, had no metahuman abilities. He was, however, at the peak of human physical and mental conditioning, having extensively studied the sciences, technology, martial arts, detection and many other disciplines under masters of their respective fields.\n     Batman was a master of stealth and infiltration ( and often revealed himself to his enemies when they least suspected him to. This also allowed him to just disappearfrom allies in mid-sentence, a habit that frequently annoyed the likes of Commissioner Gordon \n     With his martial arts prowess, occasionally augmented by technology, Batman was usually more than a match for any foe he encountered, human or otherwise. For instance, when Batman first met Superman, the vigilante suddenly threw the powerful alien across a room to Superman's complete astonishment at the attack's sheer audacity.\n     As Bruce Wayne aged and retired from active crimefighting, he still maintained his wide variety of skills including martial arts. But, due to his weak heart and aging body he couldn't engage in prolonged periods of physical excursion without complications. He could, however, use his cane as a weapon.\n     Batman's mental discipline and determination were as equally strong a weapon as his physical prowess. Batman is also a master of intimidation and psychological manipulation, specifically with the criminally minded. \n     Perhaps Batman's greatest ability was his intelligence. He was one of the foremost detectives on Earth possessing one of the sharpest analytical minds of all time.Batman is highly skilled in multiple fields of science, as well as speaking several foreign languages.As a member of the Justice League, he contributed much of the technology that kept it going, including the Watchtower and Javelins. In addition to his fighting abilities, his contributions to the team as a scientist, a detective and a strategist have proved invaluable time and again\n.",

After leaving the service, John Stewart was selected by the Guardians of the Universe to join the Green Lantern Corps. Early in his Corps career, John would train under the veteran Green Lantern Katma Tui, with whom he shared a brief romance.\n     Not long after John's homecoming, he would answer the fateful summons to join six other heroes in opposing the Imperium invasion. In the aftermath of that crisis, John readily agreed to Superman's suggestion that the seven heroes band together as the Justice League.\n\nSaving the world:\n     John was the focal point of one of the League's earliest missions. A detachment of Manhunter Robots were sent to Earth to take John into custody, to answer charges of inadvertently destroying an inhabited world. The League followed, ready to stand up for their comrade despite John's insistence that he be held accountable for his actions. The League was able to prove that John was innocent, and that the entire situation had been framed and engineered by the Manhunters as part of a plot to exact revenge upon their former masters  the Guardians.\n     John continued to serve with distinction in the Justice League, forming a strong bond with his comrades. In particular, John grew closer to Hawkgirl. Although the two clashed at first, their shared military/police backgrounds provided common ground, and in time, the two became romantically involved.\n     When the time traveler Chronos came back in time to steal Batman's utility belt, John, Wonder Woman and Batman chased him back to the Old West where they assisted him and a group of western heroes against Tobias Manning. Even though they defeated Manning, Chronos managed to get away again, but this time he went back to his own time where he warped it, resulting in the devastation of the Justice League of that time. The trio chased him again where they met up with the last members of the Justice League: Batman II, Static and Warhawk.\n     As one of the founding members of the League, John served as a voice of leadership within the organization throughout some of its most trying times, including the Cadmus crisis and the ongoing conflict with Grodd's Secret Society\n\nPowers and Abilities:\n     John Stewart possessed no innate superhuman abilities, apart perhaps from a nearly-indomitable will. He was also unfailingly honest and virtually without fear. These qualities made him an ideal candidate for membership in the Green Lantern Corps.\n     John's military experience provided him with a strong grasp of tactics, and made him a skilled combatant  armed or unarmed. On two separate missions he went into battle without his ring, and fared well.\n",

                    "History:\n     Before the invasion of Mars by the Imperium, J'onn lived a normal life with his wife, My'ria'h, and his two children. After the invasion, J'onn's wife and children died, J'onn took part in the war, and was a member of the strike team that launched his people's final, desperate offensive. J'onn succeeded in releasing the nerve gas that placed the invaders in suspended animation. As the last surviving member of the strike team, and of the entire Martian race, J'onn then sealed the invaders' underground headquarters to keep them entombed, and stood guard over it for 500 years.\n     J'onn J'onzz's natural Martian form While J'onn was in a hibernation cycle, astronauts from Earth, including J. Allen Carter, accidentally revived the invaders. J'onn awoke, managed to escape Mars, and came to Earth to warn humanity of the Imperium. Once on Earth, J'onn was captured by Imperium forces posing as members of the U.S. military.\n     After the Imperium began their invasion of Earth, J'onn reached out telepathically to several heroes on Earth: Superman, John Stewart, Hawkgirl,Wonder Woman, and Flash.\n     Superman and Batman, having already encountered the Invaders, freed J'onn, and were joined by the other heroes he had contacted. Banding together, the newly-formed team managed to destroy the Imperium and save Earth. Mindful of future threats, Superman proposed the formation of the Justice League. J'onn was initially hesitant, but Superman (who, as the sole survivor of Krypton, empathised with J'onn) assured him that he didn't have to be alone anymore.\n\nMissions:\n     When Superman was imprisoned on War World, J'onn worked covertly to sway the masses' favor to him, thus averting his execution at the hands of Mongul.\n     Along with Superman, Green Lantern, Hawkgirl, Wonder Woman, and Flash, J'onn traveled back in time to World War II, after time had been altered by Vandal Savage. Though he was captured and tortured, J'onn managed to escape, destroying the cache of Savage's advanced technological data, and taking part in the League's successful assault on the German invasion force heading for America.\n     During a search for the fugitive Lex Luthor, Superman proposed that J'onn try a city-wide telepathic search. But when J'onn opened his mind, he was inundated with thousands of people's petty and selfish thoughts, and the experience nearly destroyed him, mentally and emotionally. Taking refuge in an isolated forest, J'onn was afraid to use his telepathic abilities again, until he saw a search party selflessly looking for a lost runaway child. Using his telepathy, J'onn located the girl and re-united her with her parents, his faith in humanity restored.\n     J'onn subsequently came to the aid of the League, left at the mercy of Luthor and the power-copying android AMAZO. J'onn allowed AMAZO to copy his own powers, knowing that the android's new telepathy would enable him to read Luthor's mind and discover his deceitful intentions. Sure enough, AMAZO turned on Luthor, destroying his battlesuit before flying into space in search of new knowledge.\n     When the rest of the League except for himself and Batman were attacked in their sleep by Dr. Destiny, J'onn used his formidable telepathic abilities to rescue his teammates from their various nightmares, and to bind them together to fight Destiny's mind control.\n     The Justice League had a battle with themselves shortly before fighting Grodd's newly formed Secret Society. When the team lost in their first encounter, J'onn was the first member to leave from the Justice League. When the rest of the League was captured in a well-organized attack by Grodd's Secret Society, J'onn managed to evade capture by masquerading as Clayface and duping Killer Frost into freezing the real Clayface in a block of ice. J'onn released his comrades just before their execution. J'onn fought with the rest of the Justice Leagueagainst the Secret Society, won in front of a cheering crowd and reformed the team alongside his friends.\n     After Superman had apparently fallen in battle, J'onn pronounced the eulogy at his funeral.J'onn also took part in the League's repulsion of the Thanagarian invasion.\n\nPowers and abilities:\n     J'onn possesses an array of superpowers which he uses to serve others. J'onn has superhuman speed, strength, limited invulnerability, telepathy, and several others. J'onn is not only able to fly but is able to do so at speeds of the level of metahumans. His super-strength causes him to be much stronger than all the members of the league outside of Superman and Wonder Woman. Under normal circumstances, J'onn is weaker than Superman but his strength can be augmented by his phase-shifting powers and his ability to grow larger. Thus, he is stronger than Superman depending on the degree he uses for his powers. His strength can be seen in Task Force X when he was literally torn in half and quickly recovering beating the Annihilator back with much force. J'onn J'onzz is arguably one of the strongest metahumans ever met..\n     He is a shapeshifer and can assume the shape of most organisms, humanoids and objects. He has shown himself able to increase his size significantly, but not to decrease it. He also uses telepathy in which he can read minds and project his thoughts. He is a powerful telepathic especially with physical contact as he is able to get into Kragger's mind by tearing apart his mental barrier. He also rescues Green Lantern, Flash, and Superman from Dr. Destiny by entering into their dreams.\n     J'onn is also able to alter his density at the molecular level, which in practice allows him to become invisible, pass through solid objects (and vice-versa), or become invulnerably solid. An increase in his density results in a blue aura that increases his strength and invulnerability on par with that of Superman. This also allows J'onn to fully recover after sustaining severe physical damage, such as being torn apart into two.\n     As the product of an advanced civilization, J'onn also possesses a wealth of scientific knowledge and technological expertise. After his long experience of war, he is a brilliant field medic, and his telepathic abilities make him a great counselor and empath. Finally, his long life gives him great wisdom and an aptitude for strategic thinking.\n",

                    "History:\n     Diana began life as a clay sculpture. Her mother, Hippolyta, Queen of the Amazons, breathed life into her so that she might have a child of her own. Diana later discovered that she had been sculpted by not just her mother, but also by her mother's lover, Hades. \n     Diana grew up as the princess of her people, beloved by everyone on the island. However, when Man's World came under attack by the Imperium, she proposed to Hippolyta that they send help. When Hippolyta refused to intervene, however, Diana still felt it was her duty to help. In the dead of night, Diana slipped into the Temple of Athena and took the goddess' magic armor. Urged on by the distress call of the Martian J'onn J'onzz, Diana left Themyscira and traveled to where she felt the summons originating.\n\nJoining the league:\n     Diana arrived in the canyon along with Hawkgirl, Green Lantern, and theFlash and took part in the battle there, even saving Hawkgirl's life from one of the fightercrafts. She was instantly noticed for her beauty and revealing armor, most notably by Flash. However, she was also seen as merely a newcomer to fighting as a hero. Green Lantern even referred to her as the rookie in the tiara.\n     Wonder Woman prevents The Imperium from escaping.Diana joined the other six individuals to combat the Imperium, first joining Batman and J'onn to destroy one of the invaders' factories in Egypt. The attack seemingly resulted in Batman's demise, forcing Diana and J'onn to meet Green Lantern and Flash in Metropolis in order to rescue the captured Superman and Hawkgirl. However, they too were captured soon after.\n     During the Imperium's torture of J'onn, Batman arrived, alive and well, to reverse the effects of the factory. Diana was freed of her bonds and punctured large holes in the building, letting the sunlight in to destroy the invaders. When the Imperium attempted to escape, Diana used her lasso to hold the ship down. After being hit by a laser cannon, Hawkgirl smashed her mace into the shuttle, buying time for Diana to regain control of the ship while the Thanagarian delivered the final blow.\n     Due to her efforts on behalf of Earth during the invasion, Diana was invited aboard the Watchtower, and she took part in the formation of the Justice League alongside Superman, Batman, Hawkgirl, Flash, Green Lantern, and J'onn.\n\nPowers and abilities:\n     Diana was blessed by the gods with amazing speed and strength. She also possessed the power of flight, silver bracelets that could deflect all sorts of projectiles, and an indestructible golden lasso. She wore armor created by the Greek god, Hephaestus. Initially, the armor was taken by Diana without permission, and thus it was some time before Diana became aware of its additional potential.\n     Diana provided additional muscle to the Justice League lineup, besides Superman. In addition, she was adept at providing cover for her allies, utilizing her bullets and bracelets routine to deflect artillery fire, lasers, and Green Lantern-style energy beams and constructs.Also of note was her golden lasso, which proved useful on multiple occasions for seizing various objects. It also contained the power to force the truth out of anyone wrapped in it.\n     Diana has shown herself to be one of the most powerful beings in the Justice League. As powerful as Superman, she gave Superman a well-matched fight when they mistook each other for monsters.\n",

                    "     The Flash, real name Wally West, is commonly known as the Fastest Man Alive, and was a young and popular superhero from Central City and a founding member of the Justice League. Apart from his vast speed powers, Wally's most significant qualities were his approachability and his down-to-earth, quintessentially human nature qualities that many said made him the heart of the Justice League.\n     In his civilian life, Wally West worked as a forensic scientist with the Central City Police Department.\n\nHistory:\n     The precise circumstances of the incident in which Wally West gained his powers have never been fully revealed. It appears that Wally was the subject of a freak accident in which lightning struck a rack of chemicals in a laboratory. Somehow this combination endowed Wally with the fantastic speed powers for which he would become renowned.\n     A variety of costumed villains, most employing high-tech equipment, would arise to challenge the Flash. Among these villains were Captain Cold,Captain Boomerang, the Mirror Master, the Trickster, the Turtle-Man, Abra Kadabra, Dr. Alchemy, Mr. Element, the Top, the Pied Piper, and Grodd.\n     Along with Green Lantern, Hawkgirl, and Wonder Woman, Flash was one of the heroes summoned to aid Superman,Batman, and J'onn J'onzz in defeating the Imperium invasion. In the aftermath of that conflict, Superman suggested that the seven heroes band together to form the Justice League. Flash, appropriately enough, was the first to agree to Superman's proposal.\n\nServices to League:\n     Wally served with distinction through the early phase of the Justice League's existence, although his sometimes brash and impulsive nature tended to clash with his teammate's personalities. At one point, the Flash went so far as to sign a lucrative endorsement deal hawking Lightspeed Energy Bars a move whose motives of personal gain met with a certain disapproval from the other Leaguers.\n     Flash assisted J'onn and Batman in retaking the Watchtower, but was ejected in an escape pod after Batman announced that he was going to direct the Watchtower into the Hyperspace Bypass generator. \n     After the Justice League expanded, Flash devoted more of his time to protecting Central City, instead of participating in League activities on a full-time basis. Nonetheless, Flash still sat alongside his fellow founding members in providing oversight to the new, larger Justice League, and was involved in many of the League's other operations. \n     Flash eventually came to be so well-regarded by the people of Central City that a Flash Appreciation Day was held in his honor. The day's main event was the dedication of the Flash Museum, a shrine to the speedster's exploits. Several of his Rogues Captain Boomerang, Captain Cold, the Trickster, and Mirror Master attempted to kill Flash, but were stopped by Flash, Batman, and Orion. \n     On a later occasion, Flash accidentally switched brains with Lex Luthor and was forced to try to impersonate the villain. His attempts did not go well, but thanks to the assistance of his fellow League members, Flash was eventually switched back to normal.\n     During Darkseid's final invasion of Earth, Flash was among the heroes who stood against him. He fought in Paris with Green Lantern and Giganta. After the battle and the disappearance of Lex Luthor and Darkseid, the Flash received a kiss from Giganta. He was last seen chasing after the remaining members of the Legion of Doom along with all the other members of the Justice League.\n\nPowers and abilities:\n     Flash had the ability to move and react at incredible speeds, many orders of magnitude greater than those of ordinary humans. He could run at velocities approaching that of light itself. Simply put, he truly was the fastest man alive.\n     Flash found many other applications for his superspeed. One was the ability to generate whirlwinds by rotating his arms at an incredible rate or by running in circles. These whirlwinds could be used to buffet opponents, or perhaps to cushion the impact of falling people or objects. Flash could even use such a whirlwind to briefly propel himself through the air.\n     Flash also had the ability to vibrate his molecules at tremendous speed, allowing him to pass unharmed through solid objects, such as through solid ice. The unstable resonance created by these vibrations would frequently cause objects to shatter or explode, such as when he defeated the Android Replica Flash. \n     Because of the sheer speed and momentum his body generated, Flash could produce results similar to that of a metahuman who possessed enhanced strength. Since his body was naturally protected from most of the effects of his speed, the ultra-fast punches and movements of Wally's limbs could produce devastating impacts that could stun or injure otherwise stronger or more powerful beings such as Superman or Brainiac. He could also throw objects at extremely high speeds, as he was able to hold off the likes of Justice Lord Superman simply by throwing rocks. There are, in fact, many other instances that show the devastating impact of a projectile thrown by the Flash.\n     The true potential of Flash's power can be seen when his body was taken over by Luthor who then proceeded to systematically take down Elongated Man, Ice, Wildcat, Stargirl, Starman, Booster Gold and even Captain Atom all apparently almost instantly and with minimum effort. Luthor also alluded to a particularly disturbing ability of the Flash: by vibrating his fingers against a person's head, he could literally destroy their brain using the powerful vibrations.\n     One side-effect of the Flash's powers was a hyper-accelerated metabolism, which caused him to be almost constantly hungry to the point that he considers an armful of hotdogs a small snack.",

                    "Coming to Earth:\n     Shayera Hol was a lieutenant and an instructor in espionage on the planet Thanagar, engaged to be married to Thangarian Commander Hro Talak. She was sent in advance of the Thanagarian invasion as a scout to determine Earths weaknesses should Thanagar's enemies, the Gordanians, attack.Her cover story was that she was tracking criminals to their fortress when she was unexpectedly teleported to Earth.\n     Hawkgirl flying after the Imperium's shuttle.Shayera eventually established herself on Earth and became known to the populace as Hawkgirl. During the Imperium invasion, Hawkgirl was telepathically summoned by J'onn J'onzz to assist in repelling the invaders. Hawkgirl was responsible for destroying the Imperium when he attempted to escape on board his personal shuttle craft.\n     Due to her efforts during the invasion, Hawkgirl was invited aboard the Watchtower, and formed the Justice League along with Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Green Lantern and J'onn.\n\nThe Justice League:\n     Hawkgirl would participate in the various missions with the Justice League, including the Manhunter threat to Oa,Vandal Savage's alteration of World War II, and Darkseid's attempt to kill Superman and remake the universe in his image.\n     Hawkgirl was once teleported, along with Martian Manhunter, John Stewart and Flash to a world of superheroes set in the 50s and 60s of the 20th century.. She and one of the heroes from this dimension named Green Guardsman stopped a villain called Music Master. She teamed up with the rest of the Justice League and the Justice Guild to fight Ray Thompson once he revealed his true intentions of evil and the Justice Guild ceased to exist.\n     During one such mission, after tracking Solomon Grundy and Aquaman to Dr. Fate, she discovered Fate's connection to Thanagar. Along with Superman and Wonder Woman, Hawkgirl discovered that Ichthultu, once worshiped on Thanagar as a god, had come to Earth. Fate, Superman, Wonder Woman, Grundy and Hawkgirl traveled to Ichthultu's world. Here, Hawkgirl developed an unlikely friendship with Grundy. The friendship would be short-lived, however. After Solomon Grundy successfully entered Ichthultu's bowels and killed a monster inside, he was rendered immobilized. Hawkgirl followed him and finished Grundy's job for him, killing Ichthultu with a strike from her magic-disrupting mace. Solomon Grundy died in her arms shortly afterwards. However, she couldn't understand why he was happy at the end, to which Aquaman replied that it was faith.\n     When the League was defeated by the combination of Brainiac and Luthor, The Flashran around the world, faster than he has ever gone, slamming hit after hit into the cyborg. When Brainiac was finally driven from Luthor, Flash had generated so much speed, he was absorbed into the mysterious Speed Force. Shayera was the one who located the extra-dimensional portal and was able to grab hold of Flash's arm. With the assistance of the six other members, the League pulled Flash back to their reality.\n\nPowers and abilities:\n     Hawkgirl ready to smash.Like all modern Thanagarians, Shayera Hol had a pair of wings growing from her back which allowed her to fly. As a Thanagarian, her physical strength, endurance and durability were also noticeably much greater than those of humans.\n     As a former member of the Thanagarian military, she had extensive training in tactics, military science, and personal combat skills. Additionally, her focus in espionage could make her a difficult opponent to track, and provided her teammates with an advantage when tracking villains.\n     Hawkgirl was incredibly skilled in martial arts. Singlehandedly, she defeated four of the Green Lantern Corps members in hand-to-hand combat.\n     Hawkgirl carries a mace made of Nth metal, which was disruptive to magical energies. She was skilled at wielding and throwing the mace accurately. Her mastery over the mace was shown when she was able to revive John Stewart after his heart stopped using electrical currents from the mace.\n     Despite her short fuse and often brutal M.O., Hawkgirl has a keen mind, as she regularly defeated Batman at chess.",

                    "     Goku , born Kakarot (Kakarotto), is the main protagonist of the Dragon Ball metaseries created by Akira Toriyama. He is the adoptive grandson of Grandpa Gohan, the husband of Chi-Chi, the father of Gohan and Goten, the grandfather of Pan, and later the great-great-grandfather of Goku Jr.\n     Cheerful, courageous and also quite naive, Goku is a Saiyanoriginally sent to Earth as an infant with the mission to destroy it. However, an accident alters his memory, causing him to grow up pure-hearted and later become Earth's greatest defender, as well as the informal leader of the Z Fighters. Throughout his life, he trains hard and strives to be the greatest warrior possible, while at the same time using his amazing strength and skills to uphold peace.\n     He was found by a young girl named Bulma when she went to search forseven mystic balls called the Dragonballs.He went looking for the Dragonballs when he and Bulma came across an old pervert called Kame Sennin. Kame Sennin was once the world's strongest man. After a while, Goku went back to Kame Sennin for training. He became super strong and was given an orange gi. He wore this gi almost through Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z.\n     In the beginning of Dragon Ball Z, we see his first son (named Gohan), which he had with his wife Chi-Chi. His brother Raditz was disappointed that Earth was still in existence, and he became furious when he figured out that Goku lost his memory of his past.\n     He held Gohan hostage and said Goku must kill 100 people before he can get his son back. Goku refused. Then he started fighting Raditz along with his rival, Piccolo. They worked together to kill Raditz. Goku made a noble sacrifice and risked his life to keep his planet and his son safe.\n     That's when he went into the dead, meeting his next trainer, Kaiousama (King Kai).Kaiousama taught Goku two powerful techniques. The first one is the Kaio-ken, which doubles his speed, strength, and senses. The second is the deadliest attack in the entire series: the Genkidama (or Spirit Bomb). This attack nearly killed the Saiyan Prince Vegeta and the terrible lizard-like Frieza. It also killed the most powerful villain in Dragon Ball Z, Kid Buu.\n     In Dragon Ball Z, Goku has 3 transformations. His first transformation is into a super saiyan. Goku first uses this form on episode 80, in the freeza saga. Then Goku transforms into a Super Saiyan 2 in his battle against Majin Vegeta. Lastly, Goku transforms into a Super Saiyan 3 in episode 230 in his battle against Majin Buu.\n     At the end of Dragon Ball Z, Goku became the most powerful being in the universe.\n\npowers and Abilities:\n     Through vigorous training, Goku has achieved many extraordinary abilities, like incredible super saiyan strength and durability. He also possesses super speed and reflexes. He can manipulate supernatural energy known as Ki and exert powerful and devastating concussive beams. Through another sub-technique of Ki manipulation, he can put an aura to surround himself in energy, gaining high invulnerability. As a child, Goku wields the Nyoi-bo, a magic staff that extends and retracts on command, given to him by his Grandfather; but as he grows older and stronger, Goku eventually stops using the staff. Goku's first means of conveyance is a magic cloud called Kinto'un, given to him by Kame-Sen'nin in return for saving his pet sea turtle. After training with Kami, he learns to fly by virtue of the technique Buku-jutsu and uses the cloud less frequently.\n     Goku's signature move is the Kamehameha, a technique learned from Kame-Sen'nin.The Kamehameha is created when you concentrate all of your body's latent energy and focusing it at one point. Kame-Sen'nin spent about 50 years to create the technique, but Goku performed a miniature version of the technique in his first try, which was enough to damage a car.\n     Another notable technique of Goku's, taught to him by Kaio-sama, is the Kaio-ken, an attack that multiplies his Ki and strength for an instant, but can also strain his body afterwards, or could even kill him.Goku's most powerful attack is the Genki-Dama, an energy sphere created by gathering Ki from surrounding animals, nature and humans, which he also learned from Kaio-sama.Goku also learns a teleportation skill called Shunkan Ido, which he learned from the inhabitants of the planet Yardrat.\n     Goku is the only Saiyan in the series to achieve all known Saiyan transformations. In Dragon Ball, he can transform into a gigantic monkey-like creature called an Ozaru when he stares at a full moon while possessing a Saiyan tail. Goku loses the ability to make this transformation when his friends cut off his tail.Although it grows back, Goku's tail is later permanently removed by Kami. Goku becomes the first Super Saiyan in a thousand years; becoming enraged when Freeza kills Kuririn on the planet Namek. Each metamorphosis changes Goku's appearance and enormously enhances his abilities. After training to better control the 1st and 2nd Levels of Super Saiyan, the 3rd Super Saiyan form causes Goku to act in a much more serious manner.\n     Another ability Goku has is to fuse with others, so long as their power levels are equalized. In the Majin Boo arc, he uses the Potara Earrings presented to him by the Old Kaio-shin, which results in a perfect fusion, but it's an permanent fusion. Goku first attempts to fuse with Gohan, but this fails when the latter is absorbed by Boo, and so he persuades the newly arrived Vegeta to fuse with him, creating Vegito.In the film Fusion Reborn, the two use the Metamorese Fusion Dance, which creates Gogeta , who sports slight visual differences from their previous merger.",

He is the eldest son of King Vegeta, the husband of Bulma, the father of Trunks and Bulla, and the great-great grandfather of Vegeta Jr. Alongside Goku,Gohan, and Piccolo, he is easily one of the most prominent characters in the series, receiving more character development after being introduced than a number of other characters.\n     Regal, egotistical and full of pride, Vegeta was once a ruthless, cold-blooded warrior and outright killer, but later abandons his role in the planet trade, instead opting to remain and live on Earth, fighting alongside the Z Fighters; all the while striving to become the universe's most powerful warrior, specifically with the mission to defeat and surpass Goku in power.\n     He travels to Earth with his comrade Nappa in order to use the Dragon Balls to wish for immortality.He and Nappa fight off the heroes, but then Goku arrives, having finished his training with Kaio-sama. Vegeta kills Nappa for losing so easily to Goku, but soon finds that he is unable to prevail against the heroes and barely escapes with his life.Vegeta travels to planet Namek in an attempt to wish for immortality using this planet's Dragon Balls, cutting the tyrant Freeza off from making the same wish in the process.Upon arrival, Vegeta manages to kill many of Freeza's henchmen as well as members of the Ginyu Force later on. He also mercilessly destroys a whole defenseless Namekian village for their Dragon Ball. Later, he is defeated and subsequently killed by Freeza, but is revived with a wish from the Earth Dragon Balls.\n     After Freeza's death, Vegeta chooses to stay on Earth and enters into a relationship with Bulma and has a son Trunks. Years later, Vegeta finally becomes a Super Saiyan and easily destroys Android #19, sent by the Red Ribbon Army to kill Goku. However, even as a Super Saiyan, he is soon defeated by Android #18. Afterwards, Vegeta ascends beyond the Super Saiyan level while training with the Trunks from an alternate future in the Room of Spirit and Time and pummels the artificial life form Cell, who has absorbed Android #17. But his cockiness leads him to allow Cell to absorb #18, upon which Cell achieves his perfect form. After Vegeta fails to defeat Cell, he is forced to participate in Cell's martial arts tournament called the Cell Games, in which he aids Gohan in order to defeat Cell in his perfect form.\n     Seven years later, Vegeta allows himself to be consumed by Bobbidi's evil power for his own desire to become powerful enough to fight and defeat Goku. However, when the monster Majin Boois revived as a result of the energy released from their fight, Vegeta goes to face him alone and sacrifices himself in an attempt to defeat Majin Boo, dedicating his sacrifice to Trunks, Bulma and Goku.] After being allowed to get his body back, Vegeta returns to Earth to help against the threat of Boo, he combines with Goku using the Potara Earrings, creating Vegito, who completely overwhelms Boo with his strength.[18][19] Eventually, he is absorbed into Boo's body and subsequently, the fusion splits. Goku and Vegeta then recover their allies who have been absorbed by Boo, causing him to undergo a new transformation, which results in his return to his original form. On the Kaio-shin's planet, Vegeta battles Boo again to buy time for Goku to gather energy for the Genki-Dama, which he uses to defeat Majin Boo once and for all.\n\npowers and Abilities:\n     Up until his tail was cut off, Vegeta could turn into a gigantic monkey-like creature called an Ozaru by looking at a full moon, an ability common of all Saiyans with tails. Vegeta has the ability to create and enhance attacks with the use of ki. He also has the ability to use Buku-jutsu, which enables him to fly Constant training and his Saiyan heritage have given him vast superhuman strength, durability, speed and reflexes.\n     Vegeta is known to give names for his various energy attacks. In his early appearance, Vegeta is seen to use attacks similar to several of the protagonists of the series, such as a Ki Disk Razor, a two fingered laser-like disk capable of cutting through solid objects, and a ki wave similar to Goku's Kamehameha. One of his better known attacks is the Galick Gun, although he uses it only once in the series proper; during his battle against Goku in an attempt to destroy the Earth.He later develops the Big Bang Attack and the Final Flash techniques, which are much more powerful than his older energy attacks. Vegeta's most commonly used tactics in the series is when he bombards an opponent with an array of small ki blasts. He is not known to have an official name for this attack, but it is usually called Rapid-Fire Energy Balls. In Dragon Ball GT, Vegeta displays a powerful new attack, entitling it the Final Shine Attack , where he uses his left hand to fire off a massive beam of green ki that widens with distance. \n     Vegeta also possesses several transformations that greatly enhance his abilities to varying degrees. He gains the ability to transform into a Super Saiyan and, through training, can further transform into advanced states of Super Saiyan as the series continues; Ascended Super Saiyan Ultra Super Saiyan and Super Saiyan 2.Vegeta can also fuse with Goku and create a warrior who has the combined power and skills of both. One method is by using the Potara Earrings presented to Goku by the Old Kaio-shin. The other method, appearing only in the anime, is by performing the 'Metamorese Fusion Dance', which creates Gogeta ",

                    "     Gohan is the first son of the series' primary protagonist Goku and his wife Chi-Chi, the older brother of Goten, the husband of Videl and father to Pan. Gohan is the first hybrid to appear in the series. He is named after Goku's adoptive grandfather, Gohan.\n     Unlike his father, Gohan lacks a passion for fighting and prefers to do so only when the need to defend his loved ones arises.Nevertheless, Gohan fights alongside the Z Fighters in the defense of Earth for much of his life. He eventually settles down with a family at the end of Dragon Ball Z, opting for the life of scholar instead.\n     Gohan is introduced as the four-year-old son of the series protagonist Goku. Described as well-mannered and reserved,Gohan's story begins following his abduction by the extraterrestrial Saiyan named Raditz, who is also his uncle. While Goku is pinned to the ground, Gohan's extreme distress explodes with the release of his dormant power, which allows him to injure Raditz. Piccolo then takes Gohan away following the fight and Goku's death, and trains him for the upcoming battle against the two other Saiyans, Vegeta and Nappa, though Piccolo is aware that training the son of his greatest enemy will be a risk.His tutelage under Piccolo forms a deep bond between the two characters, with Piccolo ultimately sacrificing himself to save Gohan during their fight with Nappa.After Vegeta's defeat, Gohan travels with Bulma and Kuririn to planet Namek to use the Dragon Balls there, as the Dragon Balls on Earth had turned to stone due to the Earth's god Kami's death.After succeeding in gathering the Dragon Balls, Gohan and the others wish Piccolo back to life, causing Kami and the Dragon Balls to be returned. \n     After Goku transforms into a Super Saiyan and defeats Freeza, Gohan is shown to settle back into school life on Earth, waiting for Goku to return home from Namek.\n     After Trunks defeats Freeza and his father King Cold then tells Goku about the Androids, Gohan goes into the wilderness with Goku and Piccolo to train for the upcoming threat. After Vegeta kills Android #19, Dr. Gero activate Androids #17 and #18, and Cell is discovered, Gohan enters the Room of Spirit and Time with Goku where they train for 1 year. Gohan makes the jump to Super Saiyan while he is in the chamber and after they emerge, both Goku and Gohan retain the physical characteristics of a Super Saiyan without any of the drawbacks of its form.After Goku initially fights Cell but realizes later that he cannot defeat him, Gohan is called to fight to the surprise of everyone else and Cell. \n     As Cell charges up one finalKamehameha wave to finish the Earth, Gohan hears the voice of his father who gives him the resolve he needs to defeat Cell. They both launch large Kamehameha waves at each other, which initiates a power struggle. Cell is about to overcome Gohan when Vegeta uses his remaining energy to blast Cell, which distracts him for a moment. Gohan uses this moment to unleash all his fury into his attack, which causes it.\n     Following Majin Boo's release and Gohan's defeat at his hands, Gohan is taken to the home planet of the Kaio-shin. After pulling out the Zeta Sword and accidentally breaking it in a training session, Gohan unwittingly releases the Old Kaio-shin, who then performs a prolonged ceremony to unlock Gohan's latent powers. Gohan then returns to Earth and confronts Boo for a second time, and temporarily defeats him.However, he, along with Gotenks and Piccolo, are later absorbed by Boo.Once revived, Gohan is able to aid Goku's Genki-dama by lending his chi.Following Boo's defeat and a ten-year gap, Gohan has finally become a scholar, is married with Videl and they have a daughter Pan.\n\npowers and Abilities:\n     As a child, Gohan is depicted with an immense amount of hidden potential, which at first only revealed itself when he experienced fierce rage or distress.The vastness of this potential is shown consistently throughout the series as he ages and learns to master his powers from constant training and battles, such as when he becomes the first Saiyan in the series to become a Super Saiyan 2, the direct successor to the Super Saiyan transformation, during his battle against Cell. Gohan's potential is then fully unlocked by Old Kaio-shin, which sees his power level rise to new heights, capable of easily overwhelming the seemingly invincible Majin Boo.\n     Gohan can also freely manipulate his ki to fly using Buku-jutsu or concentrate it into beams of ki blasts, such as the Kamehameha or the Masenko. Gohan also possesses superhuman strength,as well as superhuman speed and reflexes, as seen during his training with his younger brother Goten. Gohan can also use his ki in a defensive manner, such as generating protective energy shields.\n",

                    "     Trunks is the Human and Saiyan hybrid son of Bulma and Vegeta, and later the older brother of Bulla. \n     Trunks is from twenty years in the future where the world was in constant ruin due to the terror of Androids #17 and #18 which were created by Doctor Gero, the former chief scientist of the Red Ribbon Army.Bulma had been working on a time machine that could help change history and Trunks travels to the series' present timeline. Trunks then appears as the mysterious seventeen year old that singlehandedly kills Freeza and his father King Cold. Upon Goku's return to the planet Earth, Trunks would confide with Goku his tragic story. \n     Unknown to Trunks, Piccolo also overheard due to his acute Namekian hearing.Once he informs Goku of the events to come, Trunks gives Goku a special vaccine and returns to his own time. Trunks returns to help the present-day warriors battle the artificial humans. With the appearance of Cell, Trunks trains with his father Vegeta in the Room of Spirit and Time.After Vegeta's defeat, Trunks takes on Cell in what he thinks is a stronger level of Super Saiyan. But, due to it decreasing one's speed in exchange for the power, it proves to be ineffective so Trunks willfully concedes. He later participates in the Cell Games and is killed by Cell. After he is revived by the Dragon Balls, he returns to his own timeline in the future and defeats the artificial humans and Cell of his timeline.\n     Seven years later, eight year old Trunks participated in 25th Tenkaichi Budokai and defeated Son Goten in the junior division. Although Goten is his best friend and childhood rival, Trunks is stronger than Goten. Eager to compete in the adult division, Trunks and Goten together posed as the fighter Mighty Mask and are pitted against Android #18 in abattle royal. But they were disqualified when #18 blew their cover, revealing that they were really two people. Upon the arrival of Majin Boo, Trunks is forced to train with Goten in the Room of Spirit and Time to become the fused warrior Gotenks.\n      Gotenks fights Boo, first in the time dimension, then in the real world until the thirty minute Fusion time limit expired. Through Boo's treachery they, along with Piccolo, are absorbed by Boo, thus increasing the monster's power. Once freed, Trunks, Goten, Gohan and Piccolo are killed when Boo blows up the Earth but they are later revived by the Namekian Dragon Balls. At the end of the series, Trunks is now grown up and participates in the 28th Tenkaichi Budokai against the fighter Otokosuki.\n\npowers and Abilities:\n     Trunks possesses several abilities including superhuman strength, speed, reflexes, and energy blasts, which can be utilized by the use of chi. These attacks vary from both Trunks. Future Trunks uses his signature energy spheres such as Burning Attack and Finish Buster and powerful energy waves like Masenko and the Heat Dome Attack, the latter was enough to destroy Future Cell of his dimension. Present Trunks uses many techniques, the most prominent being Big Tree Cannon. He uses the Kamehameha and Finish Buster in movies.\n     His main means of conveyance is a technique called Buku-jutsu  which gives him the ability of flight. However, Trunks does not rely on this technique as his only conveyance as he can also be seen piloting various crafts manufactured by his family's company, including the time machine which allowed him to visit Goku in the past..\n     Trunks,, was able to fuse with Goten to become the powerful being named Gotenks; this is through the Metamorese technique called the Fusion, which was taught to them by Goku. Gotenks is able to use a variety of attacks and giving ridiculous names to basic attacks. However, Gotenks can use some techniques which both of its fusees cannot use such as Galactic Donut, which is used to trap an opponent in a donut, and his signature Super Ghost Kamikaze Attack, which create explosive ghosts which can also use Kamehameha. In this temporal form, they could achieve Super Saiyan 3 with ease, a feat that was very difficult for Goku to achieve and maintain.\n     Trunks is also known for his use of his longsword which he keeps in a scabbard mounted across his back. Trunks used this weapon to kill Freeza in the main series, as well as Android #14 in the movie Super Android 13!. Trunks uses the sword as means to attacks like Shining Sword Attack. As a child, Trunks was supposedly given the sword as a gift by the warrior Tapion after the monster Hirudegarn was defeated in the film Wrath of the Dragon.",

Goten was created in the series to replace Goku as Akira Toriyama wanted to retire Goku from the series, allowingGohan to take command. However, Toriyama was forced to bring Goku back when the fans disapproved of the decision to replace him. Goten is Gohan's younger brother, and Trunks' best friend.\n     Goten is Goku's second son, and Gohan's brother. He was the youngest to become Super Saiya-Jin, at age 5. Or at least, that's when we first see him transform. When Gohan witnesses this, he asks when in the world did this happen, to which Goten replies I don't remember .\n     Goten's best friend is Trunks, who is one year older. He can do a Fusion with Trunks to form Gotenks. He's strong, but would much rather spend his time eating than fighting. He is whiney at times, and not the smartest of all people, like Trunks is. Trunkspretty much is leader of the two, but treats Goten as an equal.\n     Goten is fond of Gohan, as is everyone else when Goku goes to the other world forever. Goten is a good warrior when on a team, but less powerful when alone. He meets his father at age seven, and his father helps him and Gohan a few times, by breaking the rules of the other world, and not taking the advice of King Kai. Goten fights for the side of good, and is one of the top fighters.\n     When he was about five years old, Gohan took him in to the woods to show him some of his moves such as becoming a super saiyan. Goten tried to become a super saiyan too, but Gohan told him that he was to young and that he needed hard training. But the second Gohan turns to Goten again, Goten's a super saiyan, making him the youngest known super saiyan in the universe!\n     Goten never knew his father until he was about seven years old because Goku was off fighting Cell. Goten was afraid of Goku when he meet him at the Tournament. He hid behind Chi-chi's leg and Goku had to coax him to come out from behind her..\n     In the series Dragon Ball GT, Goten was supposed to have joined Trunks and Goku on the search for the black star dragon balls, but an over exited Pan foils his plans. So while he is happy to be home, Goten keeps on with his kicked back life.\n     While on a date with Valese, Baby interrupts, trying to get the body of the saiyan to live in. And after Goten turns super saiyan, he succseds! After seeing his super saiyan body and skills at work, Valese belives that he may be an angel.\n\npowers and Abilities:\n     Goten has the ability to transform into a Super Saiyan at a very young age. He is the youngest half-blooded Super Saiyan in history.Goten rams to the ground at full speed. If he misses he uses an energy ball to break the fall but end's up flying towards his opponent. He demonstrated this at the world tournament Goten is capable of using this because he was able to perform the normal Kamehameha before. For this attack, he just needs to charge it longer before releasing it.Goten is famous for mispronouncing his father's move the Kamehameha by the slip of the tongue calling it Kamekameha.He first demonstrated this ability at the World Tournament while facing his best friend TrunksFamily Kamehameha is a technique used when Goten, Gohan, and Goku combine their Super Kamehameha'she ability for two beings to become one. Goten perfoms this ability many times with his best friend Trunks creating the temporarily fused being Gotenks.",

                    "     Piccolo is the Namekianreincarnation and final son of King Piccolo as well as the final villain in the Dragon Ball series, and a protagonist in the Dragon Ball Z and the Dragon Ball GT series. According to Grand Elder Guru, Piccolo, along with Kami and King Piccolo, are part of theDragon Clan, who were the original creators of the Dragon Balls.\n     A wise, expert strategist who was originally a ruthless enemy ofGoku, Piccolo later becomes a permanent member of the Z Fighters during Dragon Ball Z, specifically when he forms a close bond with Goku's son Gohan after training him in preparation for the impending arrival of the Saiyans and other future threats.\n     Introduced as the offspring and reincarnate of the demon Piccolo Daimao, Piccolo Jr. plans to continue his parent's mission of world domination, and avenge his death at the hands of Goku. Piccolo enters the 23rd Tenka'ichi Budokai under the alias Demon Junior. Piccolo fights Goku, but is defeated in the final round.\n     Five years later, Piccolo is confronted by Raditz.Realizing the Saiyan would thwart his plans for world domination, Piccolo teams up with Goku in an attempt to stop Raditz from destroying the Earth.When the two arch rivals team up, Piccolo is able to defeat Raditz, but at the cost of Goku's life. Piccolo remains amazed with the powers from Gohan and trains him in preparation to fight against the two Saiyans who will invade Earth.When the Saiyans arrive a year later, Piccolo's fondness toward Gohan results in him blocking one of Nappa's attacks aimed at Gohan, which results in the death of himself, Kami, and the Dragon Balls. After the Saiyans are defeated, Gohan and the survivors travel to Piccolo's homeworld, Namek, to revive those who died against the Saiyans with the Namekian Dragon Balls. Piccolo is resurrected on planet Namek to help Goku and others defeat the evil Freeza. He takes this time to merge with the beaten Namekian called Nail, giving Piccolo a power increase. Despite his massive power increase and going head to head with Freeza's second transformation, Freeza transforms and Piccolo is defeated and severely injured by him, leaving Goku to defeat Freeza alone.\n     After Freeza's death, Piccolo trains with Goku and Gohan for three years to prepare for a battle against two powerful Androids created by the Red Ribbon Army's Dr. Gero to kill Goku. After being defeated by Android #17 and Android #18, Piccolo seeks to unite with Kami, and gain another massive increase in power. After uniting with Kami, Piccolo becomes aware of a more dangerous threat named Cell. Before his second encounter with Cell, Piccolo once again battles the Androids, except this time he battles #17 one on one. After a somewhat even match, Cell arrives on the battle scene; Cell needs to absorb the Androids to complete his power. Piccolo is nearly killed by Cell, and he is forced to participate in a tournament created by Cell called the Cell Games, where he fights one of the seven Cell Juniors that are created by Cell, who are later destroyed by Gohan.\n     Seven years later, Piccolo acts as a trainer to Goten and Trunks and their fused form Gotenks. Piccolo trains the boys in fighting the evil creature Majin Boo, but is later absorbed by Boo along with Gotenks and Gohan and incorporated into his being. He is later freed by Goku and Vegeta, and he later gives his energy to Goku's Genki-Dama attack, which Goku uses to defeat Boo once and for all.\n\npowers and Abilities:\n     Piccolo has shown many unique abilities throughout the series. Due to his Namekian physiology, Piccolo can expand his arms, move fast enough to not be seen, regenerate lost limbs of his body so long as his head is still intact, and possesses superhuman hearing and strength. Piccolo's Chokyoshinjutsu allows him to become gigantic to the point where he is capable of reaching mountain-like heights.He also has the ability to conjure objects such as garments and a blade, including his cape and turban outfit.Among Piccolo's known psionic skills, he is able to communicate telepathically with select individuals. Thus, this enables him to read minds and mentally contact others nearby. In one instance, he alerts Trunks and Goten of Boo's proximity to the dimension where the two were training.\n     Like many other characters in Dragon Ball, Piccolo has the ability of flight through the technique called Buku-jutsu. He also possesses an attack called theBakuretsumaha (, which is fired with one hand being supported by the other. One of Piccolo's most powerful attacks is the Makankosappo an attack that is expelled from Piccolo's index and middle fingers. Unlike most energy-based attacks in Dragon Ball, the potent Makankosappo pierces its targets like a drill rather than enveloping them or exploding on contact. Another attack of Piccolo's is the Renzoku Sen Kodan, which involves firing off many orbs of energy that float around the opponent. Piccolo then squeezes his hand to make all the orbs converge onto the opponent, exploding on contact. The Masenko is another of his signature attacks, being one that he teaches to his pupil Gohan. Another move Piccolo is seen to have is the Gekiretsu Kodan which is conjured by putting his hands on his chest, gathering energy and then releasing it outwards. One of Piccolo's less frequently used techniques is the ability to fire energy rays from his eyes.\n     Piccolo can also perform the Namekian Fusion which he does with Nail on the distant planet Namek to confront Freeza and with Kami to confront the Androids as a super namek, each time greatly increased Piccolo's power level (the first time enough to clash toe-and-toe with Freeza's second form, and the latter he became much more powerful than an unmastered Super Saiyan.).",

                    "    Anthony Tony Stark was born to Howard Anthony Stark and Maria Collins Carbonell Stark, owners of the prominent US firm, Stark Industries. As a boy, Tony was fascinated with building and controlling machines. At the age of 21, Tony inherited Stark Enterprises when his parents were killed in a car accident secretly orchestrated by rival corporation Republic Oil (later ROXXON). Still lacking in business acumen, Tony promoted secretary Virginia Pepper Potts to be his executive assistant and left the majority of his workload on her so that he could avoid what he saw as a burden.\n     During the war in Afghanistan, Stark was at one of his munitions plants testing new technology for the military when he was injured by his own land mine that lodged shrapnel near his heart. Tony was then captured by a local warlord named Wong-Chu and forced under threat of death to create a doomsday weapon for him with another captive, the famed Nobel award-winning physicist, Yin Sen. The shrapnel was going to enter his heart and kill him, but he and the physicist created an arc reactor which kept the sharpnel away from his heart. In response, Tony built a suit of armor to help himself escape captivity. In the suit, Stark took on the warlord and his men and avenged Yin Sen's death, thus Iron Man was born.\n     Iron Man initially fought primarily against enemies that were a threat to him or his company, such as The Mandarin, The Melter, The Ghost, and Spymaster. He also fought against communist enemies such as The Crimson Dynamo, Black Widow,The Titanium Man, and others. Iron Man was also one of the founding members of the Avengers and, with Tony's fortune, he was able to fund the team through the Maria Stark Foundation, a non-profit charitable organization named after his late mother. He also donated the use of his boyhood manor which became Avengers Mansion, staffed by Edwin Jarvis.\n\nPowers and abilities:\nArmor:\n     Iron Man possesses powered armor that gives him superhuman strength and durability, flight, and an array of weapons. The armor is invented and worn by Stark. The weapons systems of the suit have changed over the years, but Iron Man's standard offensive weapons have always been the repulsor rays that are fired from the palms of his gauntlets. Other weapons built into various incarnations of the armor include: the uni-beam projector in its chest; pulse bolts; an electromagnetic pulse generator; and a defensive energy shield that can be extended up to 360 degrees. Other capabilities include: generating ultra-freon; creating and manipulating magnetic fields; emitting sonic blasts; and projecting 3-dimensional holograms.\n     The most recent models of Stark's armor, beginning with the Extremis Armor, are now stored in the hollow portions of Stark's bones, and the personal area networking implement used to control it is implanted in his forearm, and connected directly to his central nervous system.\nPowers:\n     After being critically injured during a battle with the Extremis-enhanced Mallen, Stark injects his nervous system with modified techno-organic virus-like body restructuring machines (the Extremis process). By rewriting his own biology, Stark is able to save his life, gain an enhanced healing factor, and partially merge with the Iron Man armor, superseding the need for bulky, AI-controlled armors in favor of lighter designs, technopathically controlled by his own brain. His enhanced technopathy extends to every piece of technology, limitless and effortlessly due to his ability to interface with communication satellites and wireless connections to increase his range. Some components of the armor-sheath are now stored in Tony's body, able to be recalled, and extruded from his own skin, at will.\n     After being forced to wipe out his brain to prevent Norman Osborn from gaining his information, Tony Stark is forced to have a new arc reactor, of Rand design installed in his chest. The process greatly improves his strength, stamina and intellect. The procedure left him with virtually no autonomic functions: as his brain was stripped of every biological function, Tony is forced to rely on a digital backup of his memories (leaving him with severe gaps and lapses in his long-term memory) and on software routine in the arc reactor for basic stimuli reaction, such as blinking and breathing. The Bleeding Edge package of armor and physical enhancement is now equal in power, if not a more advanced, version of the old Extremis tech.\n\nSkills:\n     Tony Stark is an inventive genius whose expertise in the fields of mathematics, physics, chemistry, and computer science rivals that of Reed Richards, Hank Pym, and Bruce Banner, and his expertise in electrical engineering and mechanical engineering surpasses even theirs. He is regarded as one of the most intelligent characters in the Marvel Universe. His expertise extends to his ingenuity in dealing with difficult situations, such as difficult foes and deathtraps, in which he is capable of using available tools, including his suit, in unorthodox but effective ways. He is well respected in the business world, able to command people's attention when he speaks on economic matters, having over the years built up several multi-million dollar companies from virtually nothing. He strives to be environmentally responsible in his businesses.\n     At a time when Stark was unable to use his armor for a period, he received some combat training from Captain America and has become physically formidable on his own when the situation demands it. In addition, Stark possesses great business and political acumen. On multiple occasions he reacquired control of his companies after losing them amid corporate takeovers.\n     Due to his membership in the Illuminati, Iron Man was given the Space Infinity Gem to safeguard. It allows the user to exist in any location (or all locations), move any object anywhere throughout the universe and warp or rearrange space. As with the other members of the lluminati and their respective gems, Iron Man has vowed not to use it on any occasion, even after the Secret Invasion and his fugitive status.\n     It was later discovered that Stark's intelligence is the result of an experiment by a Rigellian Recorder called Recorder 451 after his mother almost loses him while pregnant, in exchange of saving his life.",

                    "     After the outbreak of World War II in Europe, a young American patriot named Steve Rogers wanted to serve his country by joining the United States Army. When he attempted to enlist Steve was rejected, due to his skinny, anemic physique, and was classified 4-F. However, he garnered the attention of certain people including scientist Doctor Abraham Erskine who was searching for suitable volunteers/test subjects for a top secret experimental program designed to create an army of Super-Soldiers. As a result of Operation: Rebirth, Steve Rogers gained speed, strength, flexibility, endurance and agility of nearly superhuman levels. These heightened abilities coupled with his unwavering courage and never say die attitude eventually made him Captain America, a living legend.\n\nPowers:\n     Through the Super-Soldier Serum and Vita-Ray treatment, he is transformed and his strength, endurance, agility, speed, reflexes, durability, and healing are at the zenith of natural human potential. Rogers' body regularly replenishes the super-soldier serum; it does not wear off.\n     The formula enhances all of his metabolic functions and prevents the build-up of fatigue poisons in his muscles, giving him endurance far in excess of an ordinary human being. Furthermore, his enhancements are the reason why he was able to survive being frozen in suspended animation for decades. He is highly resistant to hypnosis or gases that could limit his focus. \n     Rogers' battle experience and training make him an expert tactician and an excellent field commander, with his teammates frequently deferring to his orders in battle. Thor has stated that Rogers is one of the very few humans he will take orders from and follow through the gates of Hades. Rogers' reflexes and senses are extraordinarily keen. He has blended judo, western boxing, kickboxing, and gymnastics into his own unique fighting style and is a master of multiple martial arts. Years of practice with his near-indestructible shield make him able to aim and throw it with almost unerring accuracy.\n     Rogers has vast U.S. military knowledge and is often shown to be familiar with ongoing, classified Defense Department operations. He is an expert in combat strategy, survival, acrobatics, military strategy, piloting, and demolitions. \n\nWeapons and equipment:\n     Captain America uses several shields throughout his history, the most prevalent of which is a nigh-indestructible disc-shaped shield made from an experimental alloy of steel and the fictional vibranium. The shield was cast by American metallurgist Dr. Myron MacLain, who was contracted by the U.S. government, from orders of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, to create an impenetrable substance to use for tanks during World War II.This alloy was created by accident and never duplicated, although efforts to reverse-engineer it resulted in the discovery of adamantium.\n     Captain America often uses his shield as an offensive throwing weapon.Rogers, having relinquished his regular shield to Barnes, carried a variant of the energy shield which can be used with either arm, and used to either block attacks or as an improvised offensive weapon able to cut through metal with relative ease. Much like his vibranium shield, the energy shield can be thrown, including ricocheting off multiple surfaces and returning to his hand.\n     Captain America's uniform is made of a fire-retardant material, and he wears a lightweight, bulletproof duralumin scale armor beneath his uniform for added protection. As a member of the Avengers, Rogers has an Avengers priority card, which serves as a communications device.\n     Captain America has used a custom specialized motorcycle, modified by the S.H.I.E.L.D. weapons laboratory, as well as a custom-built battle van, constructed by the Wakanda Design Group with the ability to change its color for disguise purposes (red, white and blue), and fitted to store and conceal the custom motorcycle in its rear section with a frame that allows Rogers to launch from the vehicle riding it.",

                    "     Thor is one of several powerful ancient beings who dwell in a magical realm called Asgard. Through history, these beings have been revered and worshiped as gods. Ages ago, Odin, lord of the Asgardian gods, desired a child who would one day exceed him in power. Odin wooed Gaea, the earth goddess, and from their union Thor was born in a small cave in Norway on Earth. Odin took him to be raised in Asgard by his wife,Frigga.The young Thor grew up alongside his adopted brother Loki, the trickster, who was always jealous of his more favored sibling. Thor grew in power and popularity and on his eighth birthday, Odin had the hammer Mjolnir created for him, enchanting it with powerful magic. Odin decreed that Mjolnir would be presented to Thor when his son had been proven a worthy warrior. After spending the next eight years training and performing heroic deeds, Thor was given the hammer and declared the greatest warrior in Asgard.\n\nPowers and abilities:\n     Like all Asgardians, Thor is incredibly long-lived and relies upon periodic consumption of the Golden Apples of Idunn to sustain his extended lifespan, which to date has lasted many millennia. Being the son of Odin and the elder goddess Gaea, Thor is physically the strongest of the Asgardians. If pressed in battle, Thor is capable of entering into a state known as the Warrior's Madness, which will temporarily increase his strength and stamina tenfold, although in this state he attacks friend and foe alike.\n     Thor possesses a very high resistance to physical injury that approaches invulnerability. Thor possesses keen senses that allow him to track objects traveling faster than light and hear cries from the other side of the planet.Thor has the ability to travel through time. His stamina allowed him to battle the entire Frost Giant army for nine months without any sustenance or rest; Thor has shown the ability to regenerate wounded portions of his body, including entire limbs or organs, with the aid of magical forces such as Mjolnir. Thor has superhuman speed, agility, and reflexes, enabling him to deflect bullets with his hammer. Like all Asgardians, he has immunity to all Earthly diseases and some resistance to magic. Exceptionally powerful magic can overwhelm Odin's enchantment that transforms him between Asgardian and mortal forms.\n     As the Norse god of thunder, Thor can summon the elements of the storm ( and uses Mjolnir as a tool to focus this ability, although the hammer cannot command artificial weather, only natural. He can cause these weather effects over the world and destroy entire buildings; by whirling his hammer he can lift entire buildings with the wind. As the son of the Earth goddess Gaea, Thor has shown some control over the Earth.\n     Thor is a superb hand-to-hand combatant, and is skilled in armed combat, excelling in the use of the war hammer, sword, axe and mace. Thor possesses two items which assist him in combat: the enchanted Belt of Strength, and his signature weapon, the mystical hammer Mjolnir. The first item doubles Thor's strength and endurance while the second is used to control his weather abilities; flight; energy projection and absorption; dimensional travel; matter manipulation and the most powerful of his offensives, the God Blast,the Thermo-blast, and the Anti-Force. Using Mjolnir by throwing in the desired direction and then holding on to the handle's leather loop, Thor can fly at supersonic speeds in Earth's atmosphere and travel faster than light in space. When Thor has to transport companions and/or objects to a destination by himself, he has a chariot drawn by two huge mystical goats called Toothgnasher and Toothgrinder that can fly nearly anywhere he desires almost as easily as with Mjolnir. He can throw an object out of Earth's atmosphere using his strength, and throw his hammer to Asgard from which it will return.\n     When Mjolnir was damaged, Doctor Strange bound Thor's soul into Mjolnir, meaning that if the hammer were to be broken again, Thor may die.",

                    "     Robert Bruce Banner was born to atomic scientist Dr. Brian Banner and his wife, Rebecca. Brian was convinced that his work in atomic science had altered his genetic structure and because of this he also feared that Bruce would grow up a genetic freak, when actually, Bruce was just a very gifted and intelligent child. His mother's murder and his father's arrest left Bruce in the care of his aunt, Mrs. Drake, and he grew up a social outcast due to the trauma of being abused by his father as well as witnessing his mother's abuse and murder at the hands of his father.\n     After graduating high school, he gained employment with the military at Desert Base, New Mexico under the command of General Thunderbolt Ross, who was overseeing the test of Banner's newly-created Gamma Bomb. Banner was caught in the Gamma Bomb explosion and thus exposed to an incredibly massive amount of gamma radiation.\n     After absorbing the radiation from a gamma bomb explosion, Bruce Banner became a giant, grey version of the Hulk at night.Banner's first adventure was when he was captured by the Russian villain, The Gargoyle, whom Igor Drenkov/Starsky, a communist spy who was working undercover as a scientist with Bruce Banner, had informed of Banner's transformation.Jones would soon become Bruce's sidekick, travelling with him and attempting to control the Hulk's rage. Because of Banner's lack of control over the Hulk, he was declared a menace by General Thaddeus Thunderbolt Ross, who mobilized Army personnel under his command to track down the Hulk under orders to capture him -- and to destroy him if at all possible. However, Banner would gain some control over the Hulk with radiation treatments and become a founding member of the Avengers. However this would not last long and misunderstandings with team members led to The Hulk leaving The Avengers. Banner regained the ability to conceal his condition for some time, but that would not last and he commenced to wander the country as both Banner and the Hulk.\n\nPowers and abilities:\nBruce Banner:\n     Banner is considered one of the greatest scientific minds on Earth, possessing a mind so brilliant it cannot be measured on any known intelligence test. He holds expertise in biology, chemistry, engineering, physiology, and nuclear physics. Using this knowledge, Banner creates advanced technology dubbed Bannertech, which is on par with technological development from Tony Stark or Doctor Doom. Some of these technologies include a force field that can protect him from the attacks of Hulk-level entities, and a teleporter.\nHulk:\n     The Hulk possesses the potential for limitless physical strength depending directly on his emotional state, particularly his anger.After probing, the entity Beyonder once claimed that the Hulk's potential strength had no finite element inside.Hulk became strong enough to overpower and destroy the physical form of the villainOnslaught. His strength allows him to leap into lower Earth orbit or across continents, and he has displayed superhuman speed.\n     His durability, regeneration, and endurance also increase in proportion to his temper. Hulk is resistant to injury or damage, though the degree to which varies between interpretations, but he has withstood the equivalent of solar temperatures, nuclear explosions, and planet-shattering impacts. Despite his remarkable resiliency, continuous barrages of high-caliber gunfire can hinder his movement to some degree while he can be temporarily subdued with intense attacks with chemical weapons such as anesthetic gases, although any interruption of such dosages will allow him to quickly recover. He has been shown to have both regenerative and adaptive healing abilities, including growing tissues to allow him to breathe underwater, surviving unprotected in space for extended periods, and when injured, healing from most wounds within seconds. As an effect, he has an extremely prolonged lifespan.\n     He also possesses less commonly described powers, including abilities allowing him to resist psychic control, or unwilling transformation;grow stronger from radiation or dark magic; and to see and interact with astral forms The Hulk is also able to generate omnidirectional bursts of kinetic energy that completely destroy the planet he is standing on.",

                    "     She was born as Natalia Romanova in Stalingrad, Russia to unknown parents. Nazi's set fire to the building that Natasha and her parents were living in and her mother threw Natasha out of the window into the arms of a Russian soldier named Ivan Petrovitch, who was serving in the army at the time. Ivan took care of Natasha while she was growing up and later became her chauffeur. To save Ivan's life, she accepted a place in the Soviet government's covert Red Room facility. While there, she was bio- and psycho-technologically enhanced - granting her an unusually long and lifespan and prolonged youthful appearance. While in the program she was trained by the Winter Soldier, and the two became lovers. Each Black Widow was deployed with false memories to help ensure their loyalty. Natasha was given memories of becoming a ballerina, but eventually discovered this fact, along with the knowledge that the Red Room is still active as 2R.\n     The Red Room kidnaps and brainwashes her again, and with the Swordsman and the first Power Man, she battles the Avengers. She eventually breaks free from her psychological conditioning (with the help of Hawkeye), and does successfully defect, having further adventures with Spider-Man, with Hawkeye and with Daredevil.She ultimately joins the Avengers as a costumed heroine herself.\n\nAbilities:\n     The Black Widow is a world class athlete, gymnast, acrobat, aerialist capable of numerous complex maneuvers and feats, expert martial artist (including karate, judo, ninjutsu, aikido, savate, various styles of kung fu, and boxing), marksman, and weapons specialist as well as having extensive espionage training.She is also an accomplished ballerina.\n     Natasha has received the Red Room's variant of the Super-Soldier Serum. As a result, her physical and mental abilities had been enhanced slightly beyond human limits.\n     The Black Widow has been enhanced by biotechnology that makes her body resistant to aging and disease and heals at an above human rate; as well as psychological conditioning that suppresses her memory of true events as opposed to implanted ones of the past without the aid of specially designed system suppressant drugs.The Soviet experimentation has rendered her body infertile\n     Due to the Super-Soldier Serum, the white blood cells in her body are efficient enough to fight off any microbe, foreign body and others from her body, keeping her healthy and immune to most, if not all infections, diseases and disorders. Also, it takes quite a bit for Natasha to become intoxicated.\n     Her agility is greater than that of an Olympic gold medalist. She can coordinate her body with balance, flexibility, and dexterity easily.\n     Her bodily tissues have been augmented to superhuman development. She possesses exceptional durability, strength, endurance, and stamina.\n     Natasha's reaction time is similarly enhanced and functions with the peak of human efficiency and capability, bordering on superhuman level. It is possible for Natasha to dodge a bullet even at point blank range.\n     Natasha has a gifted intellect.She displays an uncanny affinity for psychological manipulation and can mask her real emotions perfectly. Like Steve Rogers, she possesses the ability to quickly process multiple information streams (e.g., threat assessment) and rapidly respond to changing tactical situations.\n     Natasha is an expert tactician. She is a very effective strategist, tactician, and field commander. She has led the Avengers and even S.H.I.E.L.D. on one occasion.",

                    "     Over the years Hawkeye has remained a mainstay to the Avengers and has proved to be a favorite among fans and creators alike. Starting out as a b-list Iron Man villain, Hawkeye became cemented in Avengers lore when the hotheaded bowman was selected to join the team as a replacement for Iron Man. Over the years, Hawkeye has been through several major developments from adopting the Goliath identity, eloping with Mockingbird, leading his own team of Avengers and dying at the hands of one of his friends. Whether he is acting as Hawkeye, Goliath or Ronin, one thing remains the same: Clint Barton is ready to answer the call of Avengers Assemble!.\n\nPowers and abilities:\n     While Hawkeye has no superhuman powers (with the exception of the period when using Pym particles to become Goliath), he is at the very peak of human conditioning; he is an exceptional fencer, acrobat and a grandmaster marksman, having been trained from childhood in the circus and by the criminals Trick Shotand Swordsman. This includes considerable strength.\n     Hawkeye has also been thoroughly trained by Captain America in tactics, martial arts, and hand-to-hand combat. Hawkeye excels in the use of ranged weapons, especially the bow and arrow, and carries a quiver containing a number of customized trick arrows. In his role as Ronin, Barton shows great proficiency with the katana and other melee weapons. He has gained a reputation for being able to turn any object into a weapon, and has been seen using items such as tin plates, coins, sticks and other debris to great effect against his enemies.\n     Hawkeye is also known to use a Sky-Cycle as his mode of transportation. The Sky-Cycle is modelled after a commercial snowmobile and is fitted with anti-gravitational technology. It is voice-operated and has an auto-pilot steering system. The original Sky-Cycle was custom made for Hawkeye by Jorge Latham while he was employed by Cross Technological Enterprises.Latham was later employed by the West Coast Avengers and built several more.\n\nTrick arrows used by Hawkeye include:\n     Acid Arrows,Adamantium Arrows,Boomerang Arrowhead,Electrical Arrow,Electromagnetic pulse arrow,Blast Arrow,Freeze arrow,Magnetic Arrowhead ,Rocket Arrowhead,Smoke Arrow,HyperSonic Arrow,Tear Gas Arrow,Vibration Arrow",

That man ended up marrying Charles' mother, Sharon Xavier.\n     Charles Xavier had a vision of a world where humans and mutant could live together and benefit from each other strengths. Xavier tried to achieve this by promoting the peaceful affirmation of mutant rights, facilitating the co-existence of mutants and humans, protecting mutants from humans, protecting humans from the evil mutants such as Magneto. His school for higher learning helped him reach out to young mutants and help mold them into responsible mutants who only used their powers for the benefits of all mankind. His relationship with the member of his school and its staff is later strained by his need to manipulate them to serve his purposes.\n     His is often seen as an advocate for mutant rights and sought after for his thought on various mutant issues that exist in comics outside of the X-Men. Early on in the series, the X-Men almost never act without the permission or leadership if Xavier.\n     Charles is seen to have a dark side in certain stories in the comic. This is seen during the Onslaught story line. Onslaught is created when Charles allows himself to succumbs to this darker side.

                    "     Since the founding of the X-Men, Cyclops has been a stalwart field leader and one of the mutant team's most iconic members. Chosen by Professor Xavier as his successor to lead the X-Men and carry on his ideals, a heavy burden was placed on Scott's shoulders from a young age. Over the years he has grown from a taciturn young man who lacked confidence in himself and his abilities into a powerful and capable leader, becoming one of the most important figures in the Marvel Universe. Strong-willed, self-disciplined, and fearlessly loyal, Cyclops possesses tremendous leadership abilities and great tactical and strategic skills. In many ways Cyclops is the X-Men, representing their ideal. Cyclops' dedication towards making Xavier's dream of peaceful coexistence between mutants and humans a reality has been a driving force in his life for many years.\n     Scott eventually emerged from Xavier's shadow as the X-Men's undisputed leader. He also became co-headmaster of the Xavier Institute for Higher Learning alongside his lover, Emma Frost. Succeeding Professor X as the authority figure of the X-Men caused significant change in Cyclops' character. No longer defined by his strict adherence to Xavier's ideology, Cyclops has become far more confident, audacious, and pragmatic. As leader of the X-Men, he has had to embrace his own vision for the future of mutantkind in a world that fears and hates them.\n\nPowers and abilities:\n     Cyclops emits beams of energy from his eyes, described as optic blasts, which have the appearance of red light and deliver massive concussive force. The beams cause no recoil or heat, but are tremendously powerful, and can be used to rupture steel plates and pulverize rock. The beams constantly emanate from his eyes involuntarily, and can generally only be stopped by his own eyelids, or by shielding his eyes with ruby-quartz, a translucent  mineral; Cyclops wears ruby-quartz as lenses in glasses or in his visor, which is generally the only way for him to safely see without inadvertently damaging his surroundings. The beams' involuntary nature has been explained as a psychological shortcoming that resulted from childhood trauma.Cyclops can nevertheless manipulate the beams in several different ways, partially through the use of adjustable apertures in his eyewear that allow the beams to fire through their shielding at variable levels.\n     In addition varying the beam width, height, and intensity, Cyclops has demonstrated a high degree of skill and accuracy in manipulating his optic blast. Cyclops is able to reflect the beam off hard and shiny surfaces. This feat also demonstrates his intuitive sense of spatial geometry between objects. The reflective qualities of the beams allows him to bounce the beam off many different surfaces in rapid succession.Cyclops has shown the power of his optic blast by blasting through the walls of a hardened building, tunneling through solid rock, and blowing the top off a mountain. \n     Modern accounts state that Cyclops' eyes contain inter-dimensional apertures, releasing powerful energies from another dimension into his own via the beams. These later accounts state that his body naturally metabolizes ambient energy that is used to open and focus the apertures in his eyes. The energy of the beam itself originates from this other dimension.\n     Cyclops' body is naturally immune to the beams' force. His mind projects a psionic field that envelops his body rendering it immune to his optic beam, allowing him to shut it off by simply closing his eyes.\nSpatial Awareness: Cyclops seems to possess an uncanny sense of geometry, in this sense used to describe his observation of objects around himself and the angles found between surfaces of these objects. Cyclops has repeatedly demonstrated the ability to cause his optic blasts to ricochet and/or reflect off those objects in a trajectory to his liking. This is commonly called a banked shot when applied to this talent. Cyclops has been observed causing beams to reflect from over a dozen surfaces in the course of one blast, and still hit his intended target accurately. It is his sense of superhumanly enhanced spatial awareness that allows him to perform these feats as well. \nExpert Pilot: Cyclops is an expert pilot of fixed-wing aircraft, a skill he appears to have inherited from his father. It has also been implied that his geometric sense improves his abilities in the air.\nMaster Tactician and Strategist: Cyclops has spent most of his superhero career as the leader of either the X-Men or X-Factor and has developed exceptional leadership skills. According toNick Fury's files, Scott's abilities are at their best in tense situations. Fury notes that the less time Cyclops has to think about a decision, the better that decision is.\nExpert Combatant: Cyclops also has extensive training in martial arts and unarmed combat,",

Going on the run following this - even though he can't remember it, due to his healing factor placing a mental block on him to protect him from the truth - he adopts the name Logan and ends up accidentally killing the woman he loves in the middle of a battle with Dog, who now looks just like Sabretooth, before a new mental block makes him forget that as well.\n     After accidentally slaughtering an entire town due to another berserker rage following another true love dying, Logan realizes that there's only one place for such a mentally unstable killing machine, and enlists in the military. Luckily, he meets a girl, falls in love and she gets killed. Cue another berserker rage. This pattern continues while Logan works his way through the Canadian military, a stint in Russia learning to be a spy, fighting with American soldiers in WWII, and also joining in the Spanish Civil War for a bit. \n     Post WWII, Logan travels to China and Japan, where he tries to find some semblance of peace of mind, and instead only succeeds in finding ninjas and evil demons who cause Logan to accidentally kill someone with his claws, and another true love to be killed. Anyway, bored with all the death, Logan joins the CIA, which turns out to be a very bad idea indeed.\n     By this point, Logan's memory is a bit of a mess; his healing factor keeps sealing off traumatic memories, and given that he keeps finding true loves murdered and/or accidentally killing people, there are rather a lot of those. The CIA, having realized this, decide to help out, and give him false memory implants that also just happen to help them control him that little bit better. Of course, the inevitable happens - Innocents die (killed by Sabretooth again, with the express purpose of messing with Logan's head) and Logan quits, deciding that he'd rather work for the Canadian Department of National Defense.\n     It doesn't last long; before too long, he's kidnapped by the Weapon X Program -where he gets adamantium coatings on his bones that also happens to drive him into a berserker rage that ends with him killing lots of people and disappearing into the woods a complete amnesiac.\n     As soon as Professor Xavier visited to invite him to join the X-Men, he was slicing ties and then finally joined the xmen. Wolverine has died repeatedly since joining the X-Men, and been reborn each time through a series of unlikely plot developments; this turns out to be because, each time he died, he ended up fighting an angel in the afterlife and being resurrected. He's also had all the adamantium stripped from his bones (and then reinserted), regained all of his memories as a side-effect of a trip to an alternate reality, and met his son (Now Dark Wolverine from the Dark Avengers) and his daughter, who's really a teenage female clone of him. In amongst all of this, he has, thankfully, managed to stop accidentally killing people.He did manage to kill Sabretooth, after discovering that he might be part-canine on his father's side. \n\nPowers and abilities:\nHealing and defensive powers:\n     His primary mutant power is an accelerated healing process, typically referred to as his mutant healing factor, that regenerates damaged or destroyed tissues of his body far beyond the capabilities of an ordinary human. In addition to accelerated healing of physical traumas, Wolverine's healing factor makes him extraordinarily resistant to diseases, drugs, and toxins. His healing factor is facilitated by artificial improvements he was subjected to under the Weapon X program (in later comics called the Weapon Plus program), in which his skeleton was reinforced with the virtually indestructible metal adamantium. While the adamantium in his body stops or reduces many injuries, his healing factor must also work constantly to prevent metal poisoning from killing him. \n     His healing factor also dramatically slows his aging process, allowing him to live beyond the normal lifespan of a human. Despite being born in the late 19th century, he has the appearance and vitality of a man in his physical prime. It is unknown exactly how greatly his healing factor extends his life expectancy.\n     Although his body heals, the healing factor does not suppress the pain he endures while injured. Wolverine also admits to feeling phantom pains for weeks or months after healing from his injuries.[ He does not enjoy being hurt and sometimes has to work himself up for situations where extreme pain is certain. Though he now has all of his memories, his healing abilities can provide increased recovery from psychological trauma by suppressing memories in which he experiences profound distress.\n     Xavier Protocols, a series of profiles created by Xavier that lists the strengths and weaknesses of the X-Men, states that Wolverine's healing factor is increased to incredible levels and theorizes that the only way to stop him is to decapitate him and remove his head from the vicinity of his body.\n     It is possible to suppress the efficiency of his healing powers. For example, if an object composed of carbonadium is inserted and remains lodged within his body, his healing powers are slowed dramatically.The Muramasa blade, a katana of mystic origins that can inflict wounds that nullify superhuman healing factors, can also suppress Wolverine's powers.It has also once been noted that Wolverine needs protein for his healing factor to generate tissue, meaning that if he was seriously injured and malnourished, his body might not be able to repair itself.\n     It has been suggested that Wolverine can be killed by drowning.He has stated that he is not particularly fond of being in water, due partially to the additional weight of his adamantium laced skeleton, and that he can die if held under water long enough with his healing factor only prolonging the agony. \n     It was recently revealed that, when Wolverine is injured so seriously that his body actually dies before his healing factor can repair the damage, he returns to life by fighting with Azrael, the Angel of Death, while trapped in Purgatory, due to Wolverine defeating Azrael in combat in the real world during the First World War.However, after Wolverine's soul was damaged following his resurrection and brainwashing by the Hand, he made a new deal with Azrael to repair the damage that had been done to his soul that negated their previous arrangement, with the result that, the next time Wolverine sustains death-inducing injuries, he will remain dead, and his healing factor has apparently been slightly weakened in the process.\n     Due to a combination of his healing factor and high level psionic shields implanted by Professor Xavier, Wolverine's mind is highly resistant to telepathic assault and probing. Wolverine's mind also possesses what he refers to as mental scar tissue created by all of the traumatic events over the course of his life. It acts as a type of natural defense, even against a psychic as powerful as Emma Frost.\n\nOther abilities:\n     Wolverine's mutation also consists of animal-like adaptations of his body, including pronounced, and sharp fang-like canines and three retractable claws housed within each forearm. While originally depicted as bionic implants created by the Weapon X program,the claws are later revealed to be a natural part of his body. The claws are not made of keratin, as claws tend to be in the animal kingdom, but extremely dense bone. Wolverine's hands do not have openings for the claws to move through: they cut through his flesh every time he extrudes them, with occasional references implying that he feels a brief moment of slight pain in his hands when he unsheathes them.\n     Wolverine's senses of sight, smell, and hearing are all superhumanly acute. He can see with perfect clarity at greater distances than an ordinary human, even in near-total darkness. His hearing is enhanced in a similar manner, allowing him to both hear sounds ordinary humans cannot and also hear to greater distances. Wolverine is able to use his sense of smell to track targets by scent, even if the scent has been eroded somewhat over time by natural factors. This sense also allows him to identify shapeshifting mutants despite other forms they may take. He is also able to use his senses of smell and hearing, through concentration, as a type of natural lie detector, such as detecting a faint change in a person's heartbeat and scent due to perspiration when a lie is told.\n     On more than one occasion, Wolverine's entire skeleton, including his claws, has been molecularly infused with adamantium. Due to their coating, his claws can cut almost any known solid material, including most metals, wood, and some varieties of stone. The only known exceptions are adamantium itself and Captain America's shield, which is made out of an proto-adamantium-vibranium alloy. Wolverine's ability to slice completely through a substance depends upon both the amount of force he can exert and the thickness of the substance. His claws can also be used to block attacks or projectiles, as well as dig into surfaces allowing Wolverine to climb structures.The adamantium also weights his blows, increasing the effectiveness of his offensive capabilities. However, this also makes him exceptionally susceptible to magnetic based attacks.\n     Wolverine's healing factor also affects a number of his physical attributes by increasing them to superhuman levels. His stamina is sufficiently heightened to the point he can exert himself for numerous hours, even after exposure to powerful tranquilizers. Wolverine's agility and reflexes are also enhanced to levels that are beyond the physical limits of the finest human athlete. Due to his healing factor's constant regenerative qualities, he can push his muscles beyond the limits of the human body without injury. This, coupled by the constant demand placed on his muscles by over one hundred pounds of adamantium, grants him some degree of superhuman strength. Since the presence of the adamantium negates the natural structural limits of his bones, he can lift or move weight that would otherwise damage a human skeleton.\n     He has been depicted breaking steel chains, lifting several men above his head with one arm and throwing them through a wall, lifting Ursa Major (in grizzly bear form) over his head before tossing him across a room,and hauling a concert grand piano, which can weigh as much as 1,300 pounds, and the platform it rests on, via a harness, while climbing a sheer cliff.",

                    "Jean Grey was born the youngest of two daughters to John and Elaine Grey. Her father was a professor at Bard College History Department in Annandale-on-Hudson. Jean grew up a normal girl born and raised in New York;",
                    "     Jean Grey was born the youngest of two daughters to John and Elaine Grey. Her father was a professor at Bard College History Department in Annandale-on-Hudson. Jean grew up a normal girl born and raised in New York; but while playing with her friend Annie Richardson, Annie was struck by a car. The high emotional stress of the accident caused Jean's mutant powers to manifest well before she reached even pre-pubescence. This is rarely the case for most mutants, whose gifts typically surface in their early teens. This sudden surge in telepathic power linked Jean with her friend causing her to experience Annie's death first hand. She was so traumatized by this event that she slipped into catatonia for the next three years.\n     When Jean reached age eleven, a psychiatrist referred her parents to Professor Charles Xavier, an expert on mutation, specializing in telepathy. Following the psychiatrist's advice, the Grey's brought their young daughter to Professor Xavier's mansion in Westchester County. After his initial analysis, he informed Jean and her parents that she was a mutant, a possibility that her parents had yet to consider. The Professor recommended she stay in Salem, to attend Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters. Here she would learn to harness the massive psionic power dwelling within her. Unbeknownst to John and Elaine, this would also be her first step to becoming a founding member of Professor Xavier's X-Men. This team of young individuals would learn how to utilize their mutant powers for the betterment of all mankind; mutant and non-mutant alike.\n\nPowers and abilities:\n     Jean Grey is an Omega-level mutant, and at her highest and strongest potential was bonded with the Phoenix Force.\nTelepathy:\n     When her powers first manifest, Jean is unable to cope with her telepathy, forcing Professor X to suppress her access to it altogether. Instead, he chooses to train her in the use of her telekinesiswhile allowing her telepathy to grow at its natural rate before reintroducing it. When the Professor hides to prepare for the Z'Nox, he reopens Jean's telepathic abilities, which was initially explained by writers as Xavier 'sharing' some of his telepathy with her.\n     Jean's telepathy allows her to read, influence, control, and communicate with the minds of others, project her mind into the astral plane, and generate telepathic force blasts that can stun or kill others. Jean is one of the few telepaths skilled enough to communicate with animals (animals with high intelligence, such as dolphins, dogs, and ravens). She can also telepathically take away or control people's natural bodily functions and senses, such as sight, hearing, smell, taste, or even mutant powers. A side effect of her telepathy is that she is gifted with an eidetic memory. \nTelekinesis:\n     Her telekinetic strength and skill are both of a supremely high power-level, capable of grasping objects in Earth orbit and manipulating hundreds of components in mid-air in complex patterns. She often uses her telekinesis to lift herself and others, giving her the ability of levitation and flight. She uses her telekinesis to create durable shields and energy blasts. She later manifests a telekinetic sensitivity to objects in her immediate environment that lets her feel the texture and molecular patterns of objects, feel when other objects come into contact with them, and probe them at a molecular or subatomic level.\nPhoenix Force:\n     When transformed into Phoenix, Jean's powers escalate to a considerably higher level, allowing her to rearrange or disintegrate matter at a subatomic level, fly unaided through space, survive in any atmosphere, and manipulate electromagnetic and cosmic energies for various effects and atmospheric disturbances. She can create stargates that can transport her anywhere in the universe instantaneously. At this level, she is powerful enough to easily defeat a herald of Galactus.\n     Jean, while acting as a Phoenix Force avatar, can create 'cosmic' flames, even in seemingly impossible situations such as the vacuum of space or underwater. Jean has perfect control over these flames, and they only consume what she wills, and these flames do not require oxygen to burn, and burn so intensely that matter is consumed without by-products such as ash. The cosmic flames are a literal punctuation to the Phoenix's purpose to burn away what doesn't work, as well as being described as burning through lies and deception.\n     As the Phoenix, Jean is able to resurrect after death. In some depictions, these resurrections are immediately after she is killed, while other depictions indicate that resurrection must occur at a correct time, sometimes taking a century. The Phoenix Force allows Jean to revive, absorb, rechannel, and preserve the life-force of any kind of life-form, meaning that she can take life energy from one person and give it to others, heal herself with the same life energy, or even resurrect the dead, since the Phoenix is the sum of all life and death.",

                    "     He was born in Dunphee,Illinois.Edna and Norton McCoy are his parents. Hank McCoy's father was exposed to radiation during a meltdown when working at the nuclear power plant. Because of this, it seems to be the reason why Hank was born with unusually large feet and hands and a high I.Q. He had a huge curiosity since childhood, disassembling anything he could so he could understand the function of everything and to create a hypothesis.\n     During Hank's teen years, his mutant abilities started to show themselves and allowed him to excel in sports and academics in school. Hank ended up joining the football team after the coach asked him to kick a football and he kicked the skin off it. However, this caused jealousy amongst his classmates.\n     One day, three masked men robbed the stadium and tried to escape across it. Luckily, Hank was nearby and he managed to knock out all three men. This made it to the news. The villain known only as the Conquistador decided that he could use Hank as a weapon after seeing this report. The Conquistador successfully managed to kidnap Hank and his parents, and told him that he would release them if he stole an experimental nuclear device for him.\n     When Hank returned, the Conquistador revealed that he would actually keep Hank's parents prisoners indefinitely, until Hank was of no more use to him. Hank tried to escape and was almost killed if it wasn't for  Professor Charles Xavier,Cyclops, Iceman and Angel saving Hank, before offering a spot for him in Xavier's school (Xavier Institute for Higher Learning). The school was a haven for mutants and also the headquarters of the mutant team, the X-Men. Hank took advantage of the offer, mainly in order to further his academic intelligence and ended up completing his doctorate in biophysics at Xavier's. There, he received the codename Beast.\n\nPowers and abilities:\n     It is possible that Beast's mutation is a result of genetic atavism.However, he also possesses neotenous characteristics, which may explain him having a genius-level intellect despite his animal physique.He also possesses superhuman strength, speed and agility. He is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant, employing a unique style of acrobatic combat, from combat training he received at Professor Xavier's and coaching from Captain America.\n     The mutation gives him superhuman strength, speed, reflexes, agility, flexibility, dexterity, coordination, balance, and endurance. He is equally dexterous with all four limbs; able to perform tasks with his feet or hands with equal ease. Because of his talents and training, Beast can outperform any Olympic-level athlete, contorting his body and performing aerial feats gracefully. His strength and dexterity allow him to climb vertical surfaces with just his hands and/or feet,jump great distances and survive falls that would kill any ordinary person.\n     He also possesses enhanced senses and can track people for great distances over open terrain and his feet are sensitive enough to detect electronic signals (from bombs, listening devices, etc.) through solid walls and floors.\n     Later, Hank mutated further (from drinking an experimental solution of his own making) through the growth of grey fur covering his entire body and the enhancement of all of his existing abilities, especially his strength, and he also gained a nearly instantaneous healing factor.\n     The psychological impact of this first transformation caused Beast to experience short-term amnesia and also made it difficult for him to control his animalistic instincts, which would cause him to slip into an uncontrollable berserker rage during combat.However, his body suddenly mutated again after a short time, changing his fur color from grey to black, returning his strength back to previous levels, and losing his healing factor.He was also able to more easily control his animal instincts after this second mutation. Beast gained the ability to emit mood altering pheromones, causing sexual attraction in women. \n     After being critically wounded, Hank's body undergoes a secondary mutation, jump started by Sage. The result is a more feline appearance equivalent to that of a big cat. His strength, speed, stamina, sturdiness, and senses increase further with this change. He gains cat-like agility, flexibility, coordination, and balance, and all his senses are enhanced to twenty times that of a normal human being. In addition, Beast develops an accelerated healing factor that allows him to repair mild to moderate injuries within the span of a few hours. However, as his hands and feet change from simian to feline (going from a normal human set of four fingers to just three, retaining the opposable thumb), he loses his superhuman dexterity, once admitting that he used to play the guitar, but is now learning to play the drums instead. Following the X-Men's relocation to San Francisco, Beast discovers that he had regained some of his old manual dexterity. \nGenius-level intellect:\n     Hank possesses a brilliant intellect. He is a world-renowned biochemist, having earned Ph.D.s in Biophysics and Genetics, and is the man who cured the Legacy Virus. He frequently functions as both field medic and in-house physician for the X-Men, despite not technically having an MD. His intelligence and expertise in genetics rival that of Professor X,Moira McTaggert, and Kavita Rao. Despite this, he has never received a Nobel Prize or been elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences. A Renaissance man, McCoy is well-versed in many fields including languages,literature,philosophy,psychology, and sociology,history,art and art history,anthropology, linguistics, and music, as well as in political science and economics with a special affinity for science and technology and a penchant for quoting literary classics. \n     His vast scientific knowledge ranges from theoretical physics,quantum mechanics,differential equations, nanotechnology, anatomy,biomedicine, analytical chemistry, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering to the construction of a hyper-magnetic device. An electronics expert, he often repairs Cerebro and makes upgrades to the Danger Room settings. He has made several deus ex machina devices on par with Reed Richards, including a device that strips entities of cosmic powers.",

                    "     Storm is a descendant of an ancient royal line of white-haired, blue-eyed sorceresses (possibly mutants), who get their defining features every five generations. Her royal heritage can be traced back since the dawn of humanity and her family's kingdom lies hidden in the Great Rift Valley of Africa, the valley that spawned the human race itself. The power in her family is transferred from mother to daughter.\n     Storm, by birth, is the rightful heir to her family's kingdom and to the oldest royal family on the face of the Earth. Since her introduction, Storm has always played a very prominent role in the world of the X-Men. In her early days after her first appearance she was a major character in the new team of X-Men following the relaunch of the mutant team in 1975. Then perhaps her definitive role was as leader of the X-Men after Professor X went into space with macat Starjammers for a time. She led the team through many huge challenges: the Mutant Massacre and Inferno to name but two, even through a long period when she had lost her powers.\n     Following the return of Professor X, the X-Men were split into two teams, Gold (led by Storm) and Blue (led by Cyclops). Most recently Storm has married Black Panther and taken on a new leadership role in Wakanda.\n     Following the events of Doom War, both Storm and T'challa have left Wakanda for more heroic duties, Storm is now a main-stay member of the X-Men yet again and is currently leading the Utopia Security Team.\n\nPowers and abilities:\nWeather control:\n     Storm is one of the most powerful mutants on Earth and has demonstrated a plethora of abilities, most of which are facets of her power to manipulate the weather.Storm possesses thepsionic ability to control all forms of weather over vast areas. She has been able to control both Earthly and extraterrestrial ecosystems on several occasions. She can modify the temperature of the environment, control all forms of precipitation, humidity and moisture (at a molecular level), generate lightning and other electromagnetic atmospheric phenomena, and has demonstrated excellent control over atmospheric pressure. She can incite all forms of meteorological tempests, such as tornadoes, thunderstorms, blizzards, and hurricanes, as well as mist. She can dissipate such weather to form clear skies as well.\n     Her control is so great that she can even manipulate the air in a person's lungs. She can also control the pressure inside the human inner ear, an ability she uses to cause intense pain. She can also bend light using moisture in the air and her manipulation of mist and fog to appear partially transparent, and in later comics, nearly invisible.\n     Storm has also demonstrated the ability to control natural forces that include cosmic storms,solar wind,ocean currents, and the electromagnetic field. She has demonstrated the ability to separate water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen via electrolysis, allowing her to breathe underwater. While in outer space, she is able to affect and manipulate the interstellar and intergalactic mediums. Storm can alter her visual perceptions so as to see the universe in terms of energy patterns, detecting the flow of kinetic, thermal and electromagnetic energy behind weather phenomena and can bend this energy to her will.\n     Storm has been shown to be sensitive to the dynamics of the natural world, and her psionic powers over weather are affected by her emotions. One consequence of this connection to nature is that she often suppresses extreme feelings to prevent her emotional state from resulting in violent weather. Storm can view the Earth as weather patterns, and is able to precisely recognize her geographic position through interpretations of these patterns. Storm's mutant abilities are limited by her willpower and the strength of her body. \nMagical potential:\n     Storm's ancestry supports the use of magic and witchcraft. Many of her ancestors were sorceresses and priestesses. Storm's matrilineal powers have even been linked to the real-world Rain Queens of Balobedu, the region from which her Sorceress Supreme ancestor, Ayesha, hails.\n     The Tarot asserts Storm as being High Priestess, the First Tarot's choice one-third of the time. The other draws were the Scarlet Witch and Agatha Harkness. These three characters split the High Priestess card equally. A timeline-divergent Storm became the sorceress who taught sorcery to Magik and some of Storm's alternate universe selves possess considerable magical talent.On a separate note, it has been stated that Storm's spirit is so strong that she was able to host the consciousness of an avatar (or manifestation body]) of Eternity; in a gathering consisting of herself,Doctor Strange, Black Panther, Silver Surfer and theFantastic Four, she and Doctor Strange were the only viable candidates. \nCombat and thievery:\n     Storm is an expert thief, and a skilled, cunning and gifted hand-to-hand fighter, trained by Achmed el-Gibar, Professor X, Wolverine and T'Challa, the Black Panther. By using superior strategy, Storm has overcome physically stronger foes like Callisto and the Crimson Commando in hand-to-hand combat. Storm is an excellent marksman with handguns, and is proficient in the use of knives. Storm is also fluent in Russian, Arabic and Swahili. As part of her paraphernalia, Storm carries a set of lock-picks (with which she has an extraordinary ability at picking locks, in an early appearance she was able to pick a lock with her teeth while her physical coordination was reduced to the level of an infant and her ancestral ruby, which allows inter-dimensional transportation with the help of her lightning.",

                    "     Anna's journey begins in Caldecott County, where she was born to the beautiful Priscilla and her lover Owen. Anna-Marie, who had been nicknamed Rogue, didn't have a pleasant childhood with her aunt as Carrie used a rough education on her in an attempt to prevent her from making the same mistakes her mother made. However, Anna did not go entirely without love, as her beauty was well recognized by the boys of her town. There is one boy in particular she fell in love with, named Cody Robbins. \n     She was with him one night, under a full moon, during their first kiss, when she developed her powers, leaving her first love in a lifelong coma. Cody's father and some of the town's folk ambushed Anna's home. While Owen fought off the mob, Anna stole one of his guns and ran as far as she could into swamp land. She was seen and chased by a small part of the mob while looking at her followers; Anna ran into a stranger and fell unconscious. She never saw how, but she was rescued by the time-traveling Cable. He quickly dealt with the mutant haters and left before Anna awoke. In the swamps, holding her father's gun, she stumbled upon a beautiful woman named Raven Darkholme(Mystique).\n     Rogue is a long-time, central character in the X-Men world within the Marvel Universe. Her beginnings were as a simple villain being led on by Mystique. But her battle with Carol Danvers and the absorption of her powers of strength and flight stuck and became definitive of her for many years. The encounter with Carol Danvers also had the side-effect of introducing Rogue to the X-Men, whose line-up she would never leave again. The Ms. Marvel powerset stuck with her, even after a passage through the Siege Perilous, but finally lost these abilities after the Messiah Complex story arc. Rogue was one of the few X-Men characters whose real name had never been revealed until a long time after their first appearance. In the X-Men films, Rogue's real name is Marie. In the comics, however she called herself Anna Raven when her powers were deactivated..\n     Most recently Rogue has been shown to have control over he powers and she can now touch people and decide if she wants to take their powers or not, and has been featured in a more solo role in the X-Men Legacy series.\n\nPowers and abilities:\n     Due to the nature of her unique mutant powers, Rogue has had several different abilities over the years.\nMutant powers:\n     Rogue possesses the mutant ability to absorb the psyche and abilities of another human being (or members of some sapient alien races) through skin contact. Rogue can absorb the memories, knowledge, talents, personality, and physical abilities (whether superhuman or not) of the person she touches, as well as occasionally duplicating in herself physical characteristics of her victim. The victim's abilities and memories are absorbed for a one to 60 ratio of time of contact. The victim loses those abilities and memories for exactly the amount of time that Rogue possesses them. This absorption usually leaves the victim weakened, and sometimes renders them unconscious. Their powers may also be temporarily weakened or removed. \n     Rogue's power is constantly active, rendering her incapable of touching others without the absorption process taking place. However, evidence suggests that Rogue's inability to control her powers is psychological in nature. During the times when the Ms. Marvel personality would overtake her psyche, she was able to touch people freely.This fact has since been corroborated by the discovery that Rogue's absorption power never developed beyond the stage of its original manifestation.Xavier later rectified this by telepathically removing the psychological barriers stunting it. \n     The transfer of abilities is usually temporary, lasting for a period of time relative to how long contact is maintained, but if Rogue holds on to her victim for too long, the transfer may become permanent, leaving the victim nearly dead, as was the case with Ms. Marvel. However, it must also be noted that Ms. Marvel fought the transfer process, which Rogue attested to sometime after the incident occurred. Most often this process happens instantly when Rogue touches someone, but certain extraordinarily powerful beings have proven resistant to Rogue's power, and she may only share part of their memories and power, as was the case when Rogue once attempted to absorb power from the alien Magus.\n     As Rogue is absorbing the total psyche of a person, there is a risk of a personality overwhelming her and taking control of her body. It has also been shown that even though the memories she has absorbed eventually fade when a psyche returns to its body, remnants, or 'echoes', of the personalities of victims whose memories she has absorbed remain buried in her subconscious indefinitely, and while there is little to no risk of those personalities overwhelming her like the Ms. Marvel  personality could, they can occasionally make their presences known.\nFully developed mutant abilities:\n     Rogue's touch now simply steals the memories and abilities of individuals with whom she comes in direct skin-to-skin contact. The longer the contact, the longer Rogue retains the absorbed information, powers, and also the abilities of the individuals she absorbs. She can now control her powers at her will, making her touch lethal or non-lethal at will.This controlled obtained when Xavier removed the memory blocks that limited her control. \n     With this new control, Rogue demonstrates the ability to absorb and collectively utilize all the powers of the New X-Men, in order to defeat a rogue Predator X, with no apparent harm to either them or herself.Her power also affects aliens, such as when she was transferred to a planet in another dimension by Magik, and one of the aliens involuntarily touches her and she gains the ability to communicate in their language, along with their knowledge\n     She later uses a more lethal version of her powers against the Avengers during her fight with them, even making Falcon and She-Hulk immediately unconscious without any negative feedback on her physical self but she cannot control the minds of the ones she absorbs. She absorbs their powers and renders them unconscious for a long time.\nMs. Marvel powers:\n     As a young woman, Rogue permanently absorbed the superhuman powers and the psyche of the original Ms. Marvel.This provided her with superhuman strength, stamina, durability, reflexes, speed and a 7th sense. She was able to repel bullets and fly at sub-sonic speeds, much like Ms. Marvel could. In addition, she possessed an amalgamated mutant human/Kree  physiology that rendered her resistant to most toxins and poisons, with the added effect of making her virtually invulnerable.\n     Rogue also gained a precognitive seventh sense that enables her to predict an enemy's move subconsciously during battle. She used this ability to predict where Nightcrawler would teleport and from which direction Magus of the Technarchy would attack.This ability was not always reliable, however, and would randomly and sporadically activate.\n     When she possessed Carol Danvers' psyche, her double consciousness made her highly resistant to telepathic probes, even those of Charles Xavier, which was said to have been a byproduct of two minds existing in one body and/or Carol Danvers' Kree physiology. Rogue could also draw upon the combat and espionage training of Carol Danvers by allowing her alternate personality, a duplicate of Danvers', to dominate her conscious mind.\n     When Rogue later lost all of her superhuman abilities for a time, her Ms. Marvel powers vanished for quite some time and did not return until later when Rogue absorbed an injured Cadre K girl named Z'Cann.\nX-Treme abilities:\n     During the Maximum Security miniseries, Rogue absorbed an injured Cadre Kgirl named Z'Cann. The girl held on longer than necessary, using her mind control to boost the process and because of this (perhaps because she had absorbed a fluid Skrull physiology) Rogue mutated further, gaining the ability to 'recall' the powers of anyone she had ever absorbed before, though she could not control when or which of these powers surfaced. For a short time Rogue also had a Skrull appearance, scanned as though she had Skrull DNA, and had their shapeshifting powers, but these soon faded and she returned to her normal appearance.\n     Through meditation, Rogue learned how to suppress the random manifestations of most of these abilities, but found herself with Wolverine's claws and healing factor, and Cyclops' optic blasts for a time (she had to wear ruby quartz glasses), while also still retaining her mutant and Ms. Marvel powers.\n     Later, Sage used her own mutant abilities to 'jump-start' Rogue's power, giving her the control to manifest any ability she had ever absorbed, whenever she wished to. It is generally accepted that after regaining her abilities after X-Treme X-Men, she has lost this ability.\n     Though Z'Cann was a telepath, Rogue never displayed this power (though she did manifest telepathy, it was with the Phoenix energy form, so it was most likely an echo of Jean Grey's powers).\nSunfire powers:\n     Rogue absorbed a large portion of the mutant Sunfire's solar-absorption based powers. In addition to her own natural mutant abilities Rogue could then project intense heat and flame, envelop her body in a fiery aura, fly by focusing her power downwards in a tight stream to propel her like a rocket, focus her power inward to increase her strength (though not at her Ms. Marvel levels), exercise immunity to heat and radiation, and see the infra-red spectrum. Rogue was eventually purged of these abilities when she came into contact with Hope Summers.",

                    "     Kurt Wagner is the product of a love affair between two mutants, both with origins that have never fully been explained. His mother was the terrorist Mystique, who at the time was the wife of Baron Christian Wagner, believed to be the father of Nightcrawler for a long time. In truth, his father is the Neyaphem warlord, Azazel, who had a great master plan to impregnate earth women with his children so he could escape the brimstone dimension.\n     When Nightcrawler was born, the townsfolk were horrified by Mystique' son's demonic appearance and so she threw him into a river, shape-shifted into another form and then claimed that she had killed the son and the mother. Azazel would not allow his son to die, so he saved him and gave him to one of his other lovers (and servant)Margali Szardos to raise. She worked as a fortune teller to hide the truth about her sorcery. Kurt had amazing agility and soon his mutant abilities would manifest. Because of these gifts, he did acrobat shows for the circus audience, while people assumed it was a man in a costume.\n     Nightcrawler struggled to be accepted by society at large, as well as by other mutants. Even so, he was usually a light-hearted character, quick to make jest or pull pranks on his fellow X-Men. He was also quite the ladies' man. As time went on, more focus was placed on Nightcrawler's Catholic faith and how he deals with the tragic experiences of his life. He became more of a sullen, introspective character, especially during his time with the team Excalibur. After returning to the United States, Nightcrawler planned to join the priesthood, but was forced back into the life of costumed adventuring before being officially ordained.\n     Professor X arrived in time to save Kurt from being killed by an angry mob and offered him a chance to join the X-Men. Kurt becomes a valued member of the X-Men and has gone on many missions since joining the team. Professor X originally gave Nightcrawler an image inducer to hide his appearance in publicKurt became extremely happy with his new home and family the X-Men.\n\nPowers and abilities:\n     Kurt Wagner is a mutant whose primary mutant power is the ability to teleport himself, his clothing, and a certain amount of additional mass from one point to another virtually instantaneously. He does this by means of displacing himself through an alternate dimension briefly and reappearing in a desired, pre-selected location. He has been shown to be able to teleport distances of up to two miles  under optimal conditions, although this is usually his extreme limit, and he can become severely fatigued if he tries to teleport that distance. He has exceeded this limit on multiple occasions Via coordinates received telepathically from Professor Xavier,. Nightcrawler's teleportation ability is also affected by direction  north-south along Earth's magnetic lines of force is easier than east-west against them.\n     He possesses a limited unconscious extrasensory spatial awareness ability which prevents him from teleporting into solid objects within his immediate vicinity, but this ability diminishes the greater the distance he teleports. Because teleporting into other solid matter would cause severe injury or death, he will only teleport to an area he is familiar with or that he can clearly see at the time or has seen in the past. His power automatically displaces liquids and gases when he arrives.\n     Extensive training has raised his tolerance for teleportation, but most of his passengers lack this tolerance. Therefore, one of his tactics is to grab opponents and make several quick teleportations with them. They usually become weakened or even pass out from the strain.\n     His teleportation power is due to a biophysical/biochemical reaction he consciously triggers within himself. In addition to his primary power of teleportation, Nightcrawler's physiology is unique in several different ways. His agility far surpasses that of an Olympic-level gymnast, and his bone structure allows him great flexibility. His spine is more flexible than an ordinary human, enabling him to remain in a crouched position for a long time and perform contortionist-type feats without causing any damage to his spine. Nightcrawler's balance and bodily coordination are all enhanced to superhuman levels. He has the ability to cling to surfaces through microscopic suction cups located on the pads of his hands and feet. He also possesses superhuman dexterity, being able to manipulate items and fence with either hand, both feet, and his tail.\n     He has the ability to blend into shadows, both as a result of his indigo fur, and the dimensional portal which always surrounds his body and absorbs photons. \n     Nightcrawler has a prehensile tail, allowing him to grab onto objects with relative ease. His tail is strong enough to not only support his body weight, but also lift an adult man completely off the ground at the same time, and is deft enough to fight with while holding a sword or blunt object. Nightcrawler's eyes (which are constantly glowing) grant him a marked degree of heightened night vision.\n     Aside from the abilities granted by his mutation, Nightcrawler is a superb fencer and a very skilled hand-to-hand combatant, to the point of being able to stalemate super-beings as powerful as Captain Britain. He has also served as the team's pilot and medic when more qualified X-Men were not around to do so. He and Wolverine were also the mechanics of the X-Men's Blackbird jet for a long time\n     He is also recognized by other Marvel characters as the leading authority on teleportation, with Spider-Man and Daredevil contacting him for information and advice following their first encounter with Francis Klum. Nightcrawler deduced from analysis of photographs of a crime scene that a man had been killed by someone else teleporting inside the victim, despite having never witnessed such a thing before. ",

                    "     Kitty was born in Deerfield, Illinois. When she was 13 years old, she began getting headaches which were the result of her mutant powers starting to manifest. Both the Hellfire Club and Professor X pursued Kitty to get her to join their cause. Kitty did not like Emma Frost or her attitude which made Kitty feel uncomfortable around her. It was an easy decision for Kitty to go with Xavier and the few X-Men accompanying him. One of the X-Men was Storm, and they quickly became friends.\n     The X-Men were abruptly attacked by mercenaries sent by Emma Frost. They battled and The X-Men defeated them easily, but Emma used her telepathy to freeze everyone. Kitty was able to slip away during the confusion and contacted Cyclops, Jean Grey, and Nightcrawler. They arrived soon after and Kitty helped them rescue the captured X-Men. Xavier returned Kitty to her parents who were furious that their daughter had been missing for an entire day. \n     When Professor Xavier requested that she be allowed to study at his School For Gifted Youngsters, Kitty's parents refused, and expressed their fear for the danger they felt he represented to their daughter. Jean Grey erased their memories and replaced them with false ones, thus changing their perception of Professor Xavier. Kitty's parents relented, and she was allowed to join the school, becoming the youngest X-Man ever.\n\nPowers and abilities:\n     Kitty is a mutant with the ability to pass through solid matter by passing her atomic particles through the spaces between the atoms of the object through which she is moving. In this way she and the object through which she is passing can temporarily merge without interacting, and each is unharmed when Shadowcat has finished passing through the object. This process is called phasing or quantum tunneling and it renders her almost completely intangible to physical touch. Shadowcat passes through objects at the same speed at which she is moving before she enters them. Since she is unable to breathe while inside an object, she can only continuously phase through solid objects (as when she travels underground) as long as she can hold her breath. \n     The use of her abilities also interferes with any electrical systems as she passes through by disrupting the flow of electrons from atom to atom, including the bio-electric systems of living bodies if she concentrates in the right way.This typically causes machines to malfunction or be destroyed as she phases through them, and can induce shock and unconsciousness in living beings.\n     While phasing, she does not physically walk on surfaces, but rather interacts with the molecules of air above them, allowing her to ascend and descend, causing her to seemingly walk on air. While phased, she is immune to most physical attacks, and has inconsistent showings of some resistance to telepathy. The density of some materials (such as adamantium) can prove deleterious to her phasing, causing her to be severely disoriented or experience pain if she tries to pass through them. Some energy attacks also prove problematic for Kitty\n     Kitty can also extend her powers to phase other people and objects. Currently, she is able to phase at least a half a dozen other people (or objects of similar mass) with her, so long as they establish and maintain physical contact with her. She can extend her phasing effect to her own clothing or any other object with mass up to that of a small truck, as long as she remains in contact with it. Kitty can also make objects intangible by maintaining contact with them. She has threatened to leave people phased into a wall.\n     Besides her mutant powers, Kitty is a genius in the field of applied technology and computer science. She is highly talented in the design and use of computer hardware. She is a skilled pilot of piston and jet engine aircraft, and a competent pilot of certain advanced interstellar vehicles. She has previously shown a unique ability to wield the Soulsword and also be harmed by it. Since her possession by the ninja demon Ogun, she has been consistently shown to be an excellent hand-to-hand combatant, having since been endowed with a lifetime of training in the martial arts of Japanese ninja and samurai, such as aikido, karate, and ninjutsu. She is also trained in the Israeli martial art of Krav Maga. She is a professional-level dancer in both ballet and modern dance. She speaks fluent English, Japanese, Russian, and the royal and standard languages of the alien Shi'ar and Skrull, and has moderate expertise in Gaelic, Hebrew, and German.\n     Kitty also shares a mental/empathic connection with Lockheed (her pet dragon); both she and the alien dragon can sense each other's presence at times and generally understand one another's thoughts and actions.",

                    "     Born Evan Daniels, Spyke is a high-school freshman, and has the mutant ability to project spikes out of his body. Born in New York, New York to an unknown father and Vivian Daniels, he is the nephew of Ororo Munroe (Storm) of the X-Men. His mutant powers are first noticed by Storm during one of his high school basketball games. The next night Storm, along with Cyclops and Jean Grey, approached Evan's parents about his mutant powers and offered him attendance to Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters. Evan angrily declines on his own behalf and leaves.\n     Only when Charles Xavier uses his pull to help Evan get out of prison (where he is serving time wrongly convicted of a crime )does he join the X-Men and the school under the codename Spyke. Spyke settles the score with Quicksilver (whom is actual perpetrator of the crime Spyke was jailed for) when he, Cyclops, and Jean defeat the speedy mutant. Spyke is cleared of all charges when he catches Quicksilver's arrogant confession on tape. During his tenure with the X-Men, Spyke did not want any special treatment from anyone at the school because he was Storm's nephew. Though he liked being an X-Man and thought of them as his family, Spyke at times acted selfishly and inconsiderate of others.\n     Spyke would goof around in class and on at least one occasion ditched school mid-class to go skateboarding with his human friends. He also was late for several training exercises in the Danger Room resulting in him getting reprimanded by Storm.\n\nPowers & Abilities:\n     Although Evan looks completely normal most of the time, his powers involve rapid bone growth - allowing him to sprout protrusions through his skin to form protective coatings and spikes. Stegosaurus-like spurs shoot out from his arms and back, which he can use offensively. The bones grow all over his face and limbs, and look really fearsome. He also needs to drink milk to replace the calcium that he loses when using his powers.Spyke, an expert skateboarder, integrated his skateboarding prowess into battles. His body also seals the wounds caused by projecting his spikes with no visible scarring\n     Unfortunately for Evan, a recent 'Power Surge' forced the spikes to become permanent and he is no longer able to draw them back into his body. Having a hard time dealing with this, he has chosen to go underground and join the misfit group of mutants known as the Morlocks. Spyke's entire body is now covered in hard, plated spikes, and he is now able to heat the tips of his spikes to the point where they are almost flaming, making him a very powerful, very dangerous warrior for the Morlocks. He also gained the power to grow small spikes on his feet to help him climb and stick to walls.",

                    "     Benjamin Ben Kirby Tennyson was a normal ten-year-old kid, until he found the Omnitrix, a powerful watch-like device that allowed him to turn into ten different aliens. Though initially immature and clumsy, he grew as a true hero. By the time he was sixteen, he had become famous in not only his hometown of Bellwood, but on Earth and beyond. Ben has also become a member of the Plumbers.\n\nPersonality:\n     Ben is initially portrayed as a cocky, arrogant, and immature boy who tends to make jokes, even when fighting enemies. He easily gets full of himself and enjoys attention from others. This attitude can sometimes make him look obnoxious or dumb, often resulting in criticisms from Gwen later Kevin and a few others. It also causes several conflicts between him and Azmuth.\n     These traits, however, as hinted in The Forge of Creation, stem from Ben's attempts to hide his own fear about the situation (though he denied it and said he was actually oblivious). Even so, he's matured since the first series and although he can be goofy, he's also capable of great leadership skills and tends to get serious when the situation requires it.\n     Despite his immaturity, Ben is actually good-hearted, and his actions are motivated above all by a strong and sincere will to help others in need. He's shown to deeply care for other's lives, and would choose to save people by himself, even when he dislikes them (such as Cash and JT). This causes him to have a strong dislike for sacrifices or life compromises and occasionally acts against reason, such as when he chooses to save half-cured DNAlien Tyler over seizing the key for the Highbreed's invasion, or when he tries to save the Sentinel while losing the last Map of Infinity piece to Ultimate Aggregor. When meeting an enemy in trouble (like Kevin or the Highbreed), he'll usually attempt to help them rather than win the hard way. While this somehow overly idealistic nature is often criticized by Azmuth, most characters usually consider it as  Ben's most important quality.Paradox once even stated that he had the gift to make the right choices at the right moments.\n     When he sees people hurt by his fault or because of his failures, Ben tends to get mad and acts much more violent and aggressive than he usually does. For example, when Overlord kidnapped Julie, or when Aggregor successfully absorbed the Andromeda aliens, Ben went berserk and beat them up with all his strength, and, in Ultimate Aggregor's case, to the point where Gwen stopped him from attacking more. Also, when Kevin mutated again shortly after stopping Ultimate Aggregor and temporarily went back to his psychotic way, hurting all the Plumbers' helpers, Ben became willing to kill Ultimate Kevin by any means necessary. He began acting ruthless, aggressive, pessimistic, cold-hearted, nasty, and even ready to fight Gwen as Way Big when she attempted to stop him. Gwen, however, was eventually able to convince him to try another way as he was about to kill Ultimate Kevin. During the episode, Ben confesses to Max he feels guilty for letting fame get into his head, and claims that he is trying to act more mature for once. Finally, in The Purge, when the Forever Knights are holding a large group of aliens hostage (and have killed some aliens already), Ben threatens to hunt the Forever Knights down for the rest of their lives if they don't let the aliens go.\n     Though often stated to be silly or unintelligent because of his immaturity, Ben is actually shown to be cunning and resourceful when needed, usually showing good adaptation skills when the Omnitrix doesn't provide him with the alien he wanted. When he occasionally put his immaturity aside (most especially in the first two seasons of Alien Force), he's shown to be a responsible leader as well as a very competent fighter.\n     It's also pertinent to note that Ben has inherited both his paternal grandparents' personality. Although Ben inherited his grandmother Verdona's spirit, sense of humor, and overconfidence, he also inherited his paternal grandfather's determination, and adventurous and self-sacrificing attitude. He is also as much of a practical joker as his Anodite paternal grandmother Verdona.\n     In Omniverse, Ben thinks of himself as more of a superhero than a Plumber. He often tells Rook that he is a superhero and not a cop. He's also gotten slightly more cocky, but still retains his selfless and heroic nature.\n\nPowers and Abilities:\n     Ben has been trained in hand-to-hand combat by black belt Gwen, Max, as well as various years fighting aliens, and received a basic Plumber training. Though he has only been trained on a weekly basis in order to minimize his reliance on the Omnitrixes/Ultimatrix, he is still proved to be quite exceptionally skilled in basic hand-to-hand combat as well armed and unarmed combat, being able to easily dodge shots from Manny's blasters and proceed to disarm him while in human form in Above and Beyond. Another hint of his exceptional hand-to-hand skill is when he succeeded in the Plumbers' Academy with a 95 out of a 100 (without using the Ultimatrix). He is also shown to be a crafty fighter.\n     However, according to Matt Wayne, Ben isn't a trained fighter and that he uses freestyle fighting.It's evident that Ben is extremely smart in some respects, possessing an above average intelligence. It was even stated by Gwen that he really isn't working up to his potential at school, and he replies, That's what they tell me. He also has fairly moderate grades (although not at Gwen or Julie's level). Chemistry is his toughest subject, yet he still maintains a B+ average.\n     In Where the Magic Happens,it is shown that Ben has a good memory, as he was perfectly capable of remembering and writing down the mystic rune-like symbols for entering the inter-dimensional realm ofLedgerdomain with just one glance from a distance. He was able to write the runes down.\n     In Perplexahedron, Ben is also shown to possess advanced intuition, as he was able to understand how Perplexahedron really worked with a small problem at first, but was then able to learn from the mistake and figure it out easily.\n     Ben is also a cross dominant, skillfully wielding tools and weapons in either hand, in human or alien form.Ben was able to dodge Attea's punches with relative ease in Vilgax Must Croak.\n\nEquipment:\n     Ben is the wielder of the prototype Omnitrix(later the Ultimatrix and then the new Omnitrix), which gave him the power to modify his own genetic code in order to turn into various alien creatures, literally making him an alien shape-shifter. Traditionally, he could only transform into ten aliens at the beginning of both the original series and Alien Force, but he later gains additional forms by either unlocking them or by scanning the DNA of aliens he meets. At the end of the original series, his arsenal included twenty aliens, while his current complete list is sixty-three aliens discovered (Ben 10,Ben 10: Alien Force, and Ben 10: Ultimate Alien, 72 ifUltimate forms are included).\n     When transforming into an alien, Ben gets all the creature's features, including its appearance, voice, all of its unique and special abilities and powers, strengths and weaknesses. Though he mostly retains his personality, there are some cases where the transformation causes change in it, such as Rath being far more aggressive,Spidermonkey acting more childish,Big Chill being affected by his reproduction instincts, Brainstorm being far more polite, or Jury Rigg having the desire to destroy/fix machines. Two of the aliens, Ghostfreak and Big Chill, even managed to actually take over Ben's personality.\n     Though he usually uses his alien forms to fight, there have been some occasions where he was taken for a real alien by others, humans especially (until his secret was revealed to the world). At one point, he intentionally impersonated Bivalvan as Water Hazard to convince P'andor to go home, and though he was unsuccessful at convincing him, P'andor believed him to be Bivalvan.\n     In addition to transforming into aliens, the Ultimatrix included what is referred as an evolutionary function, that allowed Ben to evolve his aliens forms in order to get upgraded versions of them, referred to as Ultimate Forms. It's explained that the function works by placing the selected alien form in a simulated worst-case scenario for a millennia or so, then simply modifying the old DNA to match the new DNA.\n     In addition to the primary transformations and evolutionary function, the Omnitrixes and Ultimatrix can both be used for various purposes. Both have a built in Universal Translator that allows Ben to communicate with most aliens that don't speak English.\n     During the Highbreed invasion, the prototype Omnitrix displayed the ability to manipulate and repair genetic damage, a function he used to cure DNAliens and save the Highbreed from extinction. According to Eunice in Simian Says, Ben couldn't do this with the Ultimatrix.Azmuth also mentioned that Ben could use the prototype Omnitrix to bring back to life any species stored on Primus.\n\nWeaknesses:\n     Ben's main ability with the Omnitrix is also his main weakness. Whenever the device times out, Ben is left powerless until he either dodges or switches to a new alien form. Furthermore, in addition to gaining the selected alien's powers, he gains its weaknesses. He is also vulnerable to the alien's natural predator.\n     Despite his experience in using the Omnitrixes and Ultimatrix, Ben still does not know every function of them.Due to his inquisitive nature and impatience, he has accidentally unlocked new functions such as the Master Control and the Randomizer, which can at times do more harm than good.\n     Though the current Omnitrix is designed to work only for him, Ben still has not mastered it. According to Azmuth, Ben may get the Master Control on his 18th birthday.\n     In For a Few Brains More, it is revealed that the Omnitrix does not mistransform, but rather it is due to Ben hitting the Omnitrix too hard, thereby causing the time-out function to select another alien at random. Apparently this did not happen as much with the Prototype Omnitrix when Ben was younger, as he didn't have as much strength back then.\n     Ben has an allergy to peanuts and has a fear of peacocks.\n     Ben's left eye twitches whenever he tells a lie, but only Kevin appears to notice this.Ben appears to have a short attention span at times, and more often than not it can get him into trouble. Rook has additionally pointed out that Ben tends to rely too much on his alien forms for combat.",

                    "     Gwendolyn Catherine Gwen Tennyson is Ben's ten-year old first cousin In the original series, Gwen shares a love-hate family relationship with Ben. Before discovering her dormant magical and Anodite powers, she would help Ben by simply using her innate cleverness and intelligence. She is known to be a capable gymnast and martial artist and has received a black belt in taekwondo. Gwen is a very good student, especially in the episode It's Not Easy Being Gwen, which shows that Gwen takes her education very seriously and in Ben 10: Omniverse, she is shown leaving for Ivy League College.\n     Overall, her most notable skill is her incredibly strong magical abilities. Having within her what Charmcaster calls a magical aura, Gwen is capable of using various magical artifacts, charms, talismans, spellbooks, and spells. On two occasions, Gwen has used the five Charms of Bezel to become a superheroine by the name of Lucky Girl. At first, her power and ability drew from the luck-granting Charm of Bezel, which innately gave her perfect luck. While wearing the charm, any action she took would result in a chain reaction benefiting her original intent, but usually injuring Ben in the process.\n     She later brought back her superheroine identity after obtaining the Keystone of Bezel, which greatly increased and strengthened her natural abilities to superhuman levels rather than just affecting her luck, and which granted her superhuman agility, stamina, and endurance. She was later forced to retire when the Charms of Bezel were again destroyed. However, in a twenty-year alternate future timeline, thirty-year-old Gwen had gone to the mystical interdimensional world of Bezel to receive a brand new set of mystical charms.\n     Five years later, in Ben 10: Alien Force, her magical abilities have greatly strengthened and she is easily able to control and manipulate pink/magenta/fuchsia-colored glowing energy from her magical aura to create energy blasts, shields, barriers, ropes, chains, stepping stones, and other weapons and items. Her paternal grandmother, Verdona, is an vastly powerful Anodite alien from the planet Anodyne; a free-spirited alien species who possess the ability to manipulate and control a supernatural force-like substance called manna which is the very lifeblood essence of all magic and life itself. Gwen is also able to take on an Anodite energy form just like her grandmother whenever she gets very angry, enraged or stressed. In the mystical world, Ledgerdomain, Gwen's magical and Anodite powers are tremendously supercharged and magnified.\n\nPersonality:\n     Gwen's naive nature is toned down in Ben 10: Alien Force; she is now more analytical than before. Gwen is a quick thinker and an instinctive person. At times she trusts others too quickly, and that may be a disadvantage or even injure her, like in Too Hot To Handle. She can handle dangerous situations, despite their often unfavorable conditions. An example of this being when her magical powers were drained and Charmcaster hit her with a bolt of magical energy; she immediately reversed the spell and, though she had no power left, she was able to hold herself. Gwen is at times shown to be very concerned with the well-being of things around her, such as her surroundings, the people around her, and those she cares about. She is very strong (physically and mentally) and well mannered, despite her inflating sarcasm and ego at certain times. Gwen is a very caring, compassionate person, as shown by her acceptance of Kevin's past and recent actions, as well as her statements that she does not care about Kevin's appearance\n\nPowers and Abilities:\nMana Manipulation and Energy Control:\n     Gwen can create energy blasts, sheilds,barriers. With Gwen's mana abilites her powers are mainly used like the power of energy constructing allowing her to make many different types of structures like, hammers, protective helmets, battering rams,beams to grab and throw enemies, stepping stones/platforms to carry her and others though air, saftey nets; turns out Gwen can also synchronize her martial arts styles with her energy manipulation abilities.\nMagic and Spells:\n     In Where the Magic Happens, Gwen claims that being self-taught in magic is not so easy as it looksFrom Map of Infinity onwards Gwen begins to cast spells and recite spoken incantations again. Gwen is less knowledgeable than Charmcaster and Hex, having been self taught, but she is also more powerful than Charmcaster.\n     She has also learned to astral project through magic.\nAthletics and Martial Arts:\n     Gwen is a capable gymnastic and martial artist. Even in the original series, she was occasionally shown to be quite good in hand-to-hand combat fights against enemies who had normal strength levels. At the age of fifteen it is revealed that she has already received a black belt in taekwondo.When preferring to use her athletics during fights or when she cannot rely on her magical and Anodite powers, she is shown to be highly skilled on hand-to-hand combat.\n     According to Dwayne McDuffie on one of his forums, Gwen does martial arts, horseback riding, softball, skiing and cross country. Turns out that Gwen can also synchronize her martial arts styles with her mana manipulating abilities. In the episode Ben 10,000 Returns, Gwen is shown creating a whip of mana energy and using it as a weapon along with her fighting skills. When Kevin asks her how she learned it, she states remembering it from an old movie.\nKnowledge and Intelligence:\n     Gwen is shown to be very intelligent and knowledgeable. Before discovering her dormant innate magical and Anodite powers, she would often use her brains to help Ben. She is shown to be a bit of computer and tech wiz as well. She has her own laptop which she uses to research enemies she meets.In the Back With a Vengeance, Gwen switched the Omnitrix with a bomb, saving both Ben and the world, showing her cleverness.\n\nSpells used by Gwen:\nReverto Maeos Opsmihi- helps the caster regain their magical abilities and powers if drained from them.\nTurbo- creates an extremely powerful air and wind spell that can be used in different forms.\nOrtis(Exposits)- summons a spell book from a place to the caster's hand.\nQuis quandum era mafilctus, iem fiechus mas redentegero, quis venit pro mas mesquam essei- creates a triangle- shaped portal that allows the caster to travel through time.\nAbeo Exerior- places the caster and others in dome of mana and teleports them to a certain destination.\nEratico- sucks out the life energy from someone and then traps them in an unbreakable sphere of various shades of mana.\nSomnus- makes a person fall asleep.\nAcerbus- allows the caster to turn off very bright lights.\nThrasius- makes a diamond or crystal shield around the caster that can deflect projectiles, mainly lasers.\nFacho Gravis- forces the person to be brought down to their knees by the forces of gravity.\nPontum Cartigo- brings arcade consoles to life and attack the opponent.\nTempestus Erectum- creates a strong artificial silver wind.\nTempestus Impaetus- allows the caster to summon a lightning bolt from a clear blue sky to fry the opponent.\nSilicus Milez Sositatio- summons Charmcaster's rock creatures.\nAdifishio Patentuia- fires multiple beams of glowing mana from the caster's hands but has no affect on Anodites.\nScribo Inencendia- animates a pen and causes it write on its own.\nSuper Theca- puts out flames in an instant.\nAstendo Specialis- a spell that reveals secrets.\nStatuea- emits a wave of pink mana from the casters hand that causes the target/s to become immobile.",

                    "Kevin Ethan Levin is a Human/Osmosian hybrid and is a member of Ben's Team. When Kevin first appeared in the original series, he quickly became one of Ben's most notable enemies. However, he reformed in Alien Force, and became one of the",
                    "     Kevin Ethan Levin is a Human/Osmosian hybrid and is a member of Ben's Team. When Kevin first appeared in the original series, he quickly became one of Ben's most notable enemies. However, he reformed in Alien Force, and became one of the main characters until his departure, along with Gwen, in The More Things Change: Part 1\n\nPersonality:\n     When Kevin was 11, he was a criminally insane sociopath, willing to hurt or kill anyone for his own personal gain and/or pleasure. This behavior and mentality stems not only from being seen and treated as a freak by his peers and family, but also because of the side effect of Kevin absorbing energy. His selfishness and sociopathic-nature is made apparent when he was once willing to derail a money train to steal the money and kill countless passengers on another train. He had a deep-rooted hatred for other people and society in general, even the innocent as he once said Nobody's innocent! They just haven't had the chance to make fun of me yet!.\n     Kevin's outlook changed when he met Kwarrel, a fellow prisoner in the Null Void when Kevin was a prisoner there. Becoming somewhat of a mentor and father-figure to him, Kwarrel helped greatly improve Kevin's personality. InAlien Force, despite Kevin becoming a con artist and an arms broker, he was more stable, he was somewhat mature but still had a bit of a jock att tude. As time went on and Kevin was accepted by Ben and Gwen, who were his most hated enemies and now best friend and girlfriend respectively, his personality and psyche improved greatly to the point that he became a trustworthy and reliable ally. His relationship with his friends further contributed to his mental stability as he once told Ben in Perplexahedron that he was grateful to them for changing his life. Verdona stated that Kevin's current personality is similar to a younger Max's.\n     While changing for the better, Kevin still sometimes shows a delinquent side, as seen in Kevin's Big Score, where he attempts to sell the Rust Bucket to Vulkanus for alien technology, albeit technology he intended to give to Ben and conspires with Argit to sell weapons to both sides of a warring race in Simple. Despite this side of Kevin, Ben and especially Gwen still greatly trust him.\n     Though Kevin can still be cynical, insensitive, rude, violent, greedy, and willing to kill; he is a good person at heart and generally doesn't like innocent people getting hurt; most evident in Andreas' Fault, where Kevin expresses his disgust of how Argit used Andreas and showed no sorrow or gratitude for Andreas's sacrifice and angrily punches Argit. Kevin also helped rescue Ben's mother when she was kidnapped in Hit 'Em Where They Live. Kevin, though he is rarely open about it, also has a sensitive side, as seen in The Con of Rath when Jarrett ate Tiffin. The scene was so shocking to him that he fainted, despite the fact that he is supposed to be the tough guy of the group.\n     While having a more positive outlook on life since meeting Kwarrel and making friends with Ben and Gwen, Kevin still suffers some insecurities as seen when he was mutated a second time, he was visibly disgusted with himself and fluctuated between bouts of uncontrollable aggression and severe depression that almost jeopardized his relationships, especially with Gwen. As Ultimate Kevin, he voiced his frustration against Ben the most for being a famous superhero and him still being a freak.\n     On a side note, Kevin is extremely protective of his car and becomes very upset whenever it gets damaged, which happens on a fairly regular basis\n\nPowers and Abilities:\n     Originally, in Ben 10, Kevin's powers were believed to be of an unexplained mutation but later explained to be of an alien origin. This was proven correct in Vendetta, where it is revealed that he is an Osmosian descendant/hybrid.\n     Kevin has the ability to absorb the energy and matter of anything (excluding certain materials as seen in Greetings From Techadon) though his body at will and utilize it in various ways.\nEnergy Absorption:\n     After absorbing energy, Kevin can channel energy through his hands to manipulate technology, discharge it as an energy blast or use it to speed up cellular regeneration to increase his strength or recover from injuries at an accelerated rate. However, the energy will dissipate over time or through excessive use, so he is required to recharge.\n     However, if Kevin absorbs energy, the energy will cause Kevin to become mentally unstable. Storing energy for long periods of time will worsen his instability. This mainly occurs in Osmosians who absorb energy very often but cannot control it due to inexperience and lack of skill. Energy absorption can sometimes easily turn into an addiction.\n     When Kevin has recently absorbed energy, he develops black marks around his eyes. This is a side effect of absorbing energy.\nPower Absorption:\n     Similar to his ability to absorb energy, by absorbing the DNA, metabolism, and life force of other life forms, Kevin can use it as nourishment to sustain his health and strength. Absorbing all of someone's energy will kill them. Kevin can use the energy to acquire the creature's powers and undergoes mutation to accommodate the absorbed abilities.\n     Despite complete access to any of these absorbed abilities at anytime, they aren't as strong as their pure forms, as noticed by Diamondhead who estimated that they are only about 1/10 their full power, as seen when he was able to catch and crush Kevin 11's crystals with his bare hands while the others shattered upon hitting him. This was proven correct by Aggregor. This is the reason why Aggregor first turned P'andor, Andreas, Bivalvan, Ra'ad and Galapagus into pure energy before he could absorb their powers and abilities so he could attain their full powers and abilities. He also stated that when Osmosians absorb the life force of other beings, the new powers can only be used temporarily unless they were to drain all of that life form's energy.\nMatter Absorption:\n     Kevin can absorb the properties of solid materials, transmuting himself into a living form of whatever material he has absorbed and subsequently use it to proportionately increase his physical strength and durability.\n     In Plumbers' Helpers, Kevin was able to absorb multiple materials at once. In the same episode, he also displayed the ability to apply to other people  a coating of whatever material he has absorbed at the time, temporarily.Depending on the amount of the absorbed material Kevin has available, and how he distributes it, Kevin can either coat his body, or part of it, in the material as a second skin like armor, as revealed in All That Glitters, or completely convert his body, or part of it, into a living version of the material. The amount that Kevin requires depends on the density of the material.\n     This ability has once been used productively when Kevin was forced to synthesize a coating of Taydenite, thus incapacitating him; Paradox mentioned in Vilgax Attacks that the amount Vulkanus chipped off of Kevin (in Kevin's Big Score) is now the largest stash in the galaxy.\nMatter Manipulation:\n     In season 3 of Alien Force, following Kevin's second mutation caused by the feedback from tampering with the Omnitrix, he loses the ability to revert to his human form but gradually begins learning how to use his absorbed matter in various new manners. He is able to use high levels of strength and durability as well as regenerative and shape-shifting abilities, seen when he shifts his limbs into a variety of different tools and weapons and also restoring his severed hand. Despite returning to normal in The Final Battle: Part 2 after the Omnitrix self-destructed, Kevin shows in Ultimate Alien to retain his heightened matter manipulation powers due to him now having knowledge of being able to doing so.\n     In Too Hot To Handle, Kevin's abilities have shown to have developed more, allowing him to repair objects of the current material he has absorbed either by turning it into a liquid form or releasing a liquid version of whatever material he has absorbed. He can partially merge with the actual matter and manipulate the substance's form. Both abilities were used when he repaired the rock ceiling of a mine, fused the seal of P'andor's suit, morphed it around P'andor, and fused the arms together as makeshift handcuffs.\n     In The Creature From Beyond, he used the metal he absorbed to create a helmet for Gwen to prevent the Lucubra from controlling her. \n     Kevin can easily pick locks, using his powers to absorb the material of the lock, then form his finger into a key. Kevin can also absorb liquids, and when he does he gains the properties of that liquid (according to Dwayne, if Kevin absorbs mud, objects will pass through him without causing physical damage). As seen in The Purge, if a part of his body was severed while he had absorbed some matter he could replace his hand.\n     In The Ultimate Enemy: Part 1, it is shown that Kevin can create solid matter constructs from matter he has absorbed, like the helmets he made for Gwen and Ben for protection from Diagon's mental attacks.\nOther Skills and Abilities:\n     Even without his absorption powers, as an Osmosian, Kevin is shown and proved to be stronger than an average human. While not to the same extent as aliens like Tetramands, Kevin is capable of lifting/throwing the combined weight of several people with little strain. He is also capable of resisting impacts and blunt force trauma that would severely injure an ordinary person with moderate discomfort.\n     Kevin has some noticeable skill in martial arts which he gained during his years as a runaway, a prisoner inIncarcecon, an alien tech dealer, and a member of the Plumbers. With this combat skills, he has proven on several occasions to be a highly formidable fighter, having held his own against and defeated opponents such as macat Megacruiser robots, Technorg,  and even Vilgax in a one-on-one fight, something that Ben couldn't do.\n     Despite lacking a proper normal education, Kevin possesses a vast scientific and technological knowledge of alien paraphernalia. In Deep, Ben and Kevin argue that they both cannot use their powers while being in their Plumber suits. So Kevin made some alterations to the suits, equipping them with propelling units and shock pulses that allow them to attack with electric shocks. Kevin also has great analytical and deductive skills, having been able to determine and find out specifically what happened in a battle between Aggregor and the Plumbers several hours after the battle, greatly impressing his friends and even gaining a compliment from Max that he either could be an expert police officer or a wanted criminal.\n     Kevin has good motorskills, being able to race and chase in his car and the Rust Bucket 3. He is also great at mechanics and engineering. He is shown to repair his car for the numerous damage it took during the course of the series. He also modified his car, setting alien tech for beneficial gears. On top of that he built the DX Mark 10, a car that he (reluctantly) gave to Ben as his sixteenth birthday present. Kevin is also shown to be very good with animals, even without trying. In Deep, a Little Fish became strongly attached to Kevin. Later, Khyber's dog (now named as Zed), despite being well-trained and loyal to Khyber, ultimately chose to join Kevin, even saving Kevin from being crushed.",

                    "     Maxwell Max Tennyson is the sixty-year old paternal grandfather of Ben and Gwen. Despite his age, Max has shown on multiple occasions to be highly athletic and a formidable fighter. He takes his grandson gaining superpowers and super-abilities in stride and supports Ben in any way he can. Max was once in the United States Army, had been in an astronaut program, and was a Plumber and has been through his share of scrapes; Ben and Gwen didn't know of this at first, believing him to have been a literal plumber. They began questioning this after several incidents in which he displayed knowledge and skills that a plumber would not normally have; everything from military-style hand signals to a working knowledge of nuclear reactors. \n     Throughout the first season, it seems that Max knows far more about aliens than he lets on, which climaxes in the season finale, where it is revealed that he and Vilgax are old enemies, with Vilgax even going so far as to call Max a thorn in his side. Before Ben got the watch, Max tried to keep the Plumbers and the aliens a secret from his family because he wanted to protect them and he didn't want this life for his family; however, his plan failed miserably and he needed to learn to accept Ben and Gwen with this life. He begin to train them how to use their skills on the field. Keeping his secret from his sons had led his sons to resent him, and he never gave his sons a chance to learn about his life. He eventually learned the errors of his ways and he begins to realize that Ben and Gwen have what it takes to fight evil.\n     In reality, Max was indeed a plumber, but not the kind that Ben and Gwen thought he was. He was part of an organization called The Plumbers, and Max is one of the leaders, known as a Magister. It is unknown if Max's strange taste in food was acquired from his adventures to other planets during his career as a Plumber, or if its root can be found in his childhood. Max was to have been among the candidates eligible for the Apollo 11 mission, and would have gone were it not for other concerns.\n     Max is an old friend of an alien named Xylene. She, like all the other three-eyed aliens of her planet, has the powers and abilities of flight, telepathy, and telekinesis. She had intended to send the Omnitrix to Max, but Ben found it by accident during the camp trip. They seem to have been romantically involved and work well as a team. Xylene tries to convince Max to form a partnership and travel across the galaxy with her, but Max eventually turns her down twice: the first time due to his duties as a Plumber, and the second time due to his love for the kids.\n     He also had quite a genuine strong and close romantic relationship with an Anodite alien named Verdona. They ended up having two sons, Carl (Ben's father), and Frank (Gwen and Ken's father). However it seems that their mutually strong romance had slightly deteriorated as Verdona left Earth to return to her home world\n     In Ben 10: Alien Force, Max plays a part in exposing the Highbreed conspiracy. He destroyed a Xenocyte hatchery by detonating a Null Void Projector, which- after removing its focusing lens- makes a pretty good imitation of a hand grenade and produces an explosion that covers over half a mile wide. Max appeared to have been killed in the blast, but was instead sent to the Null Void, where he, calling himself The Wrench fought against Doctor Animo who had taken over. Once the conflict is over, trains a new group of young Plumbers, at the same time informing Ben and the team of any alien threats.\n\nPowers and Abilities:\n     Although Max doesn't have any super powers, he is very skilled in combat and can take on anyone who does have them as he is quite athletic for someone of his age. As a retired Plumber, he has access to a variety of various Plumber tools and weaponry, which he uses skillfully. Aside from that, his experience from his Plumber days made him knowledgeable on various species of aliens. He is also able to strategize well and is skilled in inventing new machines. In Moonstruck, it is shown that he is telepathically connected to his lover,Verdona.\n     Before joining the Plumbers, Max was a United States Air Force pilot, with dreams of joining NASA and going to the moon. Shown in the episode Moonstruck, he was an expert at flying an F-104 Starfighter and was able to shoot down an alien spacecraft.",

                    "     Rook Blonko is Ben's new partner after Gwen and Kevin left and the deuteragonist in Ben 10: Omniverse. He is a Revonnahgander from the planet Revonnah.\n\nPersonality:\n     Unlike Ben, Rook is more stoic and prefers to think before acting. He used to treat Ben more like a superior instead of a friend/partner as he usually addressed him as 'sir' when they first met. He now tends to see Ben as a lesser or equal being such as saying he always has to save Ben and that, [Ben] wouldn't even be alive without Rook's help.\n     Although, Ben still manages to impress him from time to time. While he is very intelligent, his lack of experience can make him somewhat naive and often the rear of Ben's jokes. He seems to dislike chili fries. Nowadays, he sees Ben as a friend. Rook still has difficulty understanding his Earthly expressions, and he says that he still can hardly deal with 16-year old Ben. However, in Many Happy Returns, when Ben says that he doesn't always get Rook, but finds him to be cool, Rook explains that the feeling is mutual.\n     Rook is shown to be formal, such as initially calling Ben sir or referring to Gwen as Miss Tennyson. When Rook first met Ben in The More Things Change: Part 1, he was respectful of him, and inThe Frogs of War Part 2, Kevin exasperatingly points out that he's so polite.\n\nPowers and Abilities:\n     Rook uses the Proto-Tool to help him in battle. He is adapted to using the Proto-Tool as a sword, bow, grappling hook, blaster, and various other things. It has also been shown to be very nimble and has impressive acrobatic skills. He also wears Proto-Tech Armor.Rook is also a master in terms of strategy and battle tactics.\n     Rook is highly skilled in combat, combining the use of his Proto-Tool with hand-to-hand combat to disarm opponents. Through the use of hand-to-hand combat, Rook was able to fight with Ester, as well as take on and defeat multiple enemies at once even when weakened.\n     Rook has been shown to be an incredible marksman many times. Such as in A Jolt From The Past, he was able to shoot Fistrick's tank from far away on a crane.\n     It is also shown he can jump several stories high. Rook is able to understand Sotoraggian language.\n\nWeaknesses:\n     He is quite dependent on his Proto-Tool in order to fight. If it runs out of battery, he can't fight. As shown in Hot Stretch, Rook can't handle high temperatures for long periods of time due to having fur.",

                    "     Azmuth is a thousand year old Galvan (Grey Matter's species), as well the genius who created the Omnitrix, part of the Ultimatrix, the Unitrix, Ascalon, and the first Galvanic Mechomorphs. Azmuth is an extremely intelligent being, even as far as Galvan go, Azmuth's scientific prowess and achievements have made him a respected scientist even to the other Galvans, Paradox has even called him the smartest being in the universe.\n     A thousand years ago, Azmuth was in a relationship with a female Galvan named Xenith, who attempted to stir him from harnessing the primal forces of the universe. Though he promised to view things her way, the planetary system they saw in perfect alignment inspired Azmuth to create Ascalon which can tap into the fundamental forces of the universe. Though he shrugged off the consequences of creating such a weapon, losing Xenith's love in the process, Azmuth is horrified to find that Ascalon was stolen by an Incursion who hoped to end the eons-long civil war between the many factions on his homeworld. The result however, was the destruction of the Incursion homeworld. Shocked by what he had done, Azmuth vowed to hide away the sword and gave it to Sir George, who used the weapon to defeat Dagon with the weapon sealed along with the entity's heart.\n     Soon after, Azmuth dedicated himself to peaceful sciences, one of which was the creation of the Omnitrix as an apology to both the galaxy and Xenith, to be a tool of peace in an act of repentance following the destruction wrought by his previous creation. It has a twofold purpose: it would promote inter-species understanding by allowing other beings to experience different ways of life, and it would also serve as a repository for the DNA of millions of species, preserving them in the event that any of them should ever become extinct. However, he was disgusted when some people, particularly Vilgax, considered it as a weapon. This causes Azmuth to go into hiding before being found by Ben who needed his help to deactivate the Omnitrix's self-destruct sequence, convincing him there is still hope for the universe as he enable Ben to access Way Big and returned to Galvan Prime. Since then, Azmuth became more optimistic as he attempted to make up for lost time such as attempting to aid Malware as shown during the events of Trouble Helix.\n     In Ben 10: Alien Force, Azmuth's former assistant Albedo creates a copy of the Omnitrix. After the copy nearly destroyed a galaxy, Azmuth shows up and punishes Albedo by breaking his Omnitrix, leaving him de-powered and trapped in Ben's human form, before sending him to prison. He then stated that Ben is the only one who used the Omnitrix for good, and decides to let him find his own way to use it rather than advise him, saying that he has far more difficult challenges ahead and that he isn't the only one who believes Ben is the only one who thinks so. Later, Azmuth and Paradox warn Ben that the Highbreed are conquering planets and their fleet is heading towards Earth. And Galvan Prime was already conquered by then and its destruction would be the beginning of the end. Although he doesn't want Ben to fight, he realizes that there's no stopping him and activates the Master Control for the sake of the battle. When the Master Control was reset by the DNA wave Ben used to stop the Highbreed, Azmuth left to help rebuild Galvan without reactivating it. He shows a no-nonsense attitude towards the High-Breed's plan to eradicate Earth and he warmly tells Ben that there are more difficult battles to be fought in the future.\n     Following the defeat of Dagon, Azmuth removes the Ultimatrix and places a new Omnitrix on Ben. When asked by Ben if he is ready to learn the Master Code, Azmuth states that he'll consider this by Ben's 18th birthday. He deactivated the Ultimatrix after giving to Ben, and gave him a newly modified Omnitrix.\n\nPersonality:\n     Azmuth is very paranoid, evidenced by the amount of work he puts into hiding his home from the rest of the universe. He is a bit impolite. He originally refused to repair the Omnitrix in Ben 10: Secret of the Omnitrix, and was willing to let the universe get destroyed.\n     Azmuth was very pessimistic, unwilling to shut down the Omnitrix's self-destruct at first, despite it meaning the destruction of the universe. The reason why is that he simply didn't believe the universe was worth saving. This is because he invented the Omnitrix so the aliens of the universe would have a better understanding of each other, but other people like Vilgax only wanted to use it as a weapon of war. In Alien Force, Azmuth has become less pessimistic and more serious, showing a no-nonsense personality in War of the Worlds. This is especially apparent in Map of Infinity, where he was dealing with a disaster of intergalactic proportions, and when the universe or galaxy is being threatened.\n     But despite everything, Azmuth is good at heart and always thinks about the betterment of the society.\n\nPowers and Abilities:\n     Even by the super-intelligent Galvan standards, Azmuth's mental prowess is considered worlds apart from the rest of his race. He is well-regarded as the smartest being in the universe (or at least 3 to 5 galaxies). He is often referred to by his Galvan peers as the First Thinker.\n     Along with his intelligence, Azmuth is gifted with years of experience and knowledge that was gained due to his age.Azmuth is a skilled inventor, having created numerous inventions, his greatest being the Omnitrix.Because he created the Omnitrix, Azmuth knows all about its functions so he has the potential to use any model of the Omnitrix more effectively than anyone else. In Primus, Azmuth briefly uses the Omnitrix himself to fight Vilgax.\n\nWeaknesses:\n     Despite being the Omnitrix's creator, Azmuth has been shown have less skill fighting with it than Ben. Azmuth attributes this to being a little out of practice.",

His character is inspired by the Doctor from Doctor Who.\n     He was originally a scientist from 1952 who discovered special properties in quartz crystals and received government funding to work on breaking a hole in the Space-Time Continuum, code-named the Paradox Project, with his assistant Hugo at the military base Los Soledad during the Cold War. But a slight miscalculation caused Paradox to get sucked into the Event Horizon, where he remained displaced from time for a 100,000 years. Losing his mind and regaining his sanity, he gained a complete understanding of the Space-Time Continuum. Having long forgot his name, he renamed himself Paradox and uses his understanding to travel across time to make different parts of history better for others. At some point in his time-traveling career, Paradox separated the pieces of the Map of Infinity, which could lead a person to the Forge of Creation, and hid them across the universe, disguising them as objects which would be difficult to obtain, in order to prevent the map from falling into the wrong hands. Paradox also met Ben's future self in his adventures prior to meeting the future hero's younger self.\n     In his first appearance in Ben 10: Alien Force, Paradox soon learns that the accident that gave him his power also sent an extra-dimensional creature fifty years from the time of the experiment. Meeting Ben as they confront the creature, Paradox learns the monster is actually Hugo and manages to negate the monster's existence by keeping his friend from getting sucked it. After returning to Ben's present, Paradox was shocked that he didn't figure it out first as he gives an older Hugo to a behind-the-scenes look at eternity.\n     In the Ben 10: Ultimate Alien episode Ultimate Aggregor, Paradox informed the team that Aggregor was using his old time travel equipment to achieve his goals. He also gave Kevin advice concerning the future, telling him that things would get worse before they got better, and to try to remember who his friends were. He also warned Ben not to lean against the chronal randomization barrier, but doubted that he would listen. In The Forge of Creation, Paradox appears to help the team to go to the Forge of Creation which is outside the universe, but is unable to stay with them as he is not allowed to go within 500 lightyears of Celestialsapiens, per their treaty. Paradox later returns in Ben 10,000 Returns, aiding Ben and his future self against Eon. Before taking his leave, Paradox leaves Ben with a cryptical warning concerning Sir George and Dagon.\n     Returning in the Ben 10: Omniverse series, wearing a steampunk attire, Paradox is revealed to have been fighting a time war as he is pursued by Eon for the Chrono Navigator he possesses. But with Ben's help, Paradox protects the timeline though the restoration erased their meeting during that time.\n\nPowers and Abilities:\n     Due to his time in entrapment, Paradox knows how the space-time continuum works, allowing him to teleport to any location, both in time and space, slow down or speed up time as he pleases, though he states there are places he cannot go and things he cannot do, though what restricts him is not yet explained.\n     Paradox's abilities are not limited to this universe, having apparently been to other universes and the space in between.Paradox is able to regress a person's age but seems incapable of doing it on something mechanical, instead having to pull it physically out of the past.\n     Paradox can manipulate his personal time to make it appear as if he is moving (to everyone else's perspective) at superhuman speeds, but is actually just manipulating time around him and is still moving (in his perspective) at a normal velocity.\n     Paradox is capable of teleporting people, objects and even places like the Forge of Creation to almost any destination instantaneously without any trouble. However, he does have to follow certain rules; for example, he cannot bring the past and future versions of an individual together unless absolutely necessary.\n     Additionally, Paradox's time travel powers have left him biologically immortal, with no need to eat or sleep.Paradox is capable of reverting Ben from an alien back to his human form as he did to Alien X. Paradox can seemingly travel to other dimensions, although this has never been seen.\n\nWeaknesses:\n     Having a total understanding of the the space-time continuum and the power to travel down any aspect of it, gives Paradox abilities that could theoretically rival that of a Celestialsapien, (which could explain why he is not allowed to come within 500 light years of any of them).\n     If Paradox does have any weaknesses, it is his cryptic personality and his adherence to keep the timestream on a stable course. This in itself is a paradox as any of his failures to save a certain part of the continuum can be visited, undone and redone.\n     Paradox had admitted that he does not lie and Eon has confirmed this. However, this is more along the lines of a warning not to disturb the timestream unduly.Getting control of Paradox's Chrononavigator might give one an advantage over him, though this has proven to be a double-edged sword as Eon almost destroyed all reality.",

                    "     Reed Richards was born in Central City, California and the son of Nathaniel and Evelyn Richards. Reed's father was a brilliant scientific genius and a trait that Reed inherited. Reed excelled in mathematics, physics, and mechanics and was enrolled in college by the age of 14. He went to multiple colleges including Massachusetts Institute of Technology, California Institute of Technology, Harvard University, Columbia University, andEmpire State University. While attending EMU he met and became a roommate of Ben Grimm. They became great friends and Reed shared his dream of building a spaceship himself.\n     After EMU, Reed continued to go to school at Columbia University, and he rented an apartment from Sue Storm's Aunt. Sue quickly fell in love with Reed. Reed, also met Victor Von Doom, while attending Columbia University. Doom loved that Reed could rival his intellect. Eventually Doom became jealous of Reed and began conducting reckless experiments that scarred his face.\n     Reed next enrolled at Harvard and earned his P.H.D. in both physics and electrical engineering, at the age of 22. After he was done with school he used his inheritance and government funding to finance his project. He began building his spaceship in Central City. Sue Storm would move to this same area and eventually found herself dating Reed again. Reed would ask Ben to pilot the ship for him. The government denied the flight into space so Reed, Sue, Ben, and Johnny decided to sneak onto the ship and they took the ship into outer space. Reed miscalculated and forgot the abnormality of the radiation from the cosmic radiation. The rays destroyed the ship and they crash-landed back on earth. After the crash Reed found out that he could stretch his body like elastic at will. Reed adopts the name Mr. Fantastic and convinces the four of them to use their powers for good.\n\nPowers and abilities:\n     Reed Richards gained the power of elasticity from irradiation by cosmic rays. He has the ability to convert his entire body into a highly malleable state at will, allowing him to stretch, deform, and reform himself into virtually any shape. Reed Richards has been observed as being able to utilize his stretching form in a variety of offensive and defensive manners, such as compressing himself into a ball and ricocheting into enemies or flattening himself into a trampoline or a parachute to rescue a teammate. \n     Reed is also able to shape his hands into hammer and mace style weapons, and concentrate his mass into his fist. All of these feats used to require extreme concentration; however, due to mental and physical training, he can now perform these feats at will. The most extreme demonstration of Reed's powers is when at one point he was able to increase his size and mass to Thing-like proportions which also increased his physical strength.\n     Despite this, Reed Richards' strength comes more from the powers of his mind than the powers of his body; indeed, he once told Spider-Man that he considers his stretching powers to be expendable compared to his intellect.Some stories have implied that Reed's intellect may have been boosted by his powers, as he once visited an alternate universe where his other self-had never been exposed to cosmic rays and was notably less intelligent than him, though purely human versions of Reed that are as or even more intelligent than himself have been shown, particularly among the Council of Reeds.Tony Stark has commented that Reed's ability to make his brain physically larger (via his elastic powers) gives him an advantage, though this seems to be meant more as a joke. That said, scenes from the same issue show Reed inflating his skull as he calculates the power output of Tony's Repulsor-battery heart implant.\n     For virtually his entire publication history, Richards has been depicted as one of the most intelligent characters in the Marvel Universe. A visionary theoretician and an inspired machine smith, he has made breakthroughs in such varied fields as space travel, time travel, extra-dimensional travel, biochemistry, robotics, computers, synthetic polymers, communications, mutations,transportation, holography, energy generation, spectral analysis and more. However, he is never afraid to admit when others have greater expertise in certain fields than him. Richards has earned Ph.D.s in Mathematics, Physics, and Engineering. His patents are so valuable that he is able to bankroll the Fantastic Four, Inc., without any undue financial stress. Mind control is rarely effective on him and when it does work, it wears off sooner than it would a normal person, due to what he describes as an elastic consciousness.\n     Richards is also an accomplished fighter due to his years of combat experience with the Fantastic Four, and has earned a black belt in judo.",

                    "     Johnny Storm is the son of physician Franklin Storm and his wife Mary. He and his older sister Susan grew up in Glenville, New York. While still young, his mother was in a terrible car accident and she passed away, despite Franklin's attempts to repair her body. After this tragic event, Franklin fell into a downward spiral of drinking and gambling, eventually leading to his arrest for the murder of a loan shark, which he claimed was self-defense. Johnny and Sue were then sent to their Aunt's to live and Sue spend much time caring for her younger brother.\n     As a teen, Johnny and his sister met a scientist named Reed Richards and volunteered to go on an experimental rocket designed by Reed. The rocket would help humanity fly to the stars if everything worked as planned. But the ship was not properly shielded from cosmic radiation and plummeted back to the Earth's surface.\n     They all survived the horrific crash but very soon found they had been changed. Sue, Reed and the pilot, Ben Grimm, gained super powers as a result. Johnny burst into flame and soon realized he could fly. On the spot they all agreed to use their powers for good and become the Fantastic Four.\n     Still young and rebellious, Johnny was ecstatic to have his new found powers. Labeled the hot head of the group, Johnny would often make brash decisions and disobey direct orders. Although his sister would try to calm him, Johnny often had issues with following Reed's orders. He would quit the team early on (and many more times) because of his temper.\n     While at a local bar trying to avoid the other members of the team, Johnny recognized a man who claimed to be an amnesiac. Trying to see if he was right, he dropped the man in the ocean and his assumptions were correct  it was Namor, the King of the Sea. Learning Atlantis was destroyed; Namor waged war against the surface. Johnny helped the other team members stop him and rejoined the team, finally having cooled off a bit.\n     Although he was in the Fantastic Four, Johnny still had time to have his own adventures, fighting villains such as the Wizard and Paste-Pot Pete, who would later go on to have grudges against both Johnny and the Fantastic Four. The Human Torch also started dating a fellow student named Dorrie Evans. During the time that the Torch was dating Dorrie, Peter Parker ironically met her one night, and impressed her with his quiet, studying manner as opposed to Johnny's hotheadedness and eagerness. Deciding that it would be funny to see how she reacted around Spider-Man, Peter changed to Spider-Man, only to end up fighting the Beetle, another of the Human Torch's foes, who was planning to capture Dorrie for revenge on the Torch. Eventually the Torch arrived, and together he and Spider-Man defeated the Beetle and saved Dorrie, one of their earliest team-ups.\n     After an adventure with the Mole Man, the Sue Storm found a newspaper article which had a small section about her and Johnny's father. The two went to visit him in prison, but unknown to them, the Super-Skrull had kidnapped Franklin Storm and shape shifted to replace him. The Super-Skrull then went on a rampage as the Invincible Man, correctly guessing that the Torch and Invisible Woman wouldn't attack someone who they thought was their father, until Mr. Fantastic discovered the deception. The Super-Skrull agreed to return Johnny and Sue's father, but moments after they saw him, he yelled at them to escape, before a bomb which had been implanted in him exploded. Thankfully, no one was hurt except for Franklin, but he was gone from Johnny and Sue's life once more.\n\nPowers & Abilities:\n     The cosmic radiation that changed Johnny into the Human Torch gave him a vast array of fire and plasma based powers.\nHeat Absorption:\nJohnny's body is covered by flaming plasma that protects him from flames and heat. He can easily absorb fire and explosions.\nFlight:\nAs the density of his body changes, Johnny's body becomes lighter than air, giving him the capabilities of flight. He is also extremely maneuverable. The faster he goes, the shorter his limit becomes. At normal speed (about fifty air miles per hour) he should be able to fly for a half-hour, a distance of twenty-five miles.\nFire Control:\nWith his flames, Johnny can create shapes and objects out of flame. He can also control any fire within his range of vision no matter how it formed. Johnny can also control which parts of his body he has in flame in order to touch someone or something that he doesn't want to burn.\nSuper Speed:\nThe Human Torch can easily break the sound barrier while in flight.\nEnergy Output:\nThe plasma field around Johnny's body produces intense flame which can be raised and lowered in temperature. The heat can easily dissipate most projectiles.\nBlast Power:\nThe Human Torch can create streams or balls of flame and use them as projectiles. Special attacks include the Nova Flame, a multi-directional attack capable of over 1,000,000 degrees Fahrenheit and the Nova Heat, an offensive beam of heat rivaling the heat of a normal star.",

                    "     Sue Storm and her younger brother Johnny had a pretty normal and happy childhood until their mother died in a car accident. Their father, Dr. Franklin Storm who was a famous and talented surgeon, could not save her life. Unfortunately, Franklin was unable to cope with the loss. As a result he became an alcoholic and a gambler. He got into a scuffle with a loan shark and accidentally killed him, and was later charged with murder, sending him to jail. Sue visited him in jail but her father asked her not to visit anymore and to tell Johnny that he was dead. He felt ashamed of his actions and believed he was not worthy of his children. At this point Sue was forced to become both mother and sister to Johnny. Caring for her brother throughout most their childhood caused Sue to mature far earlier than most children her age. Eventually, the Storm siblings moved in with their aunt who owned a boarding house, and it was there she met the man who would shape her life. Sue met and fell forReed Richards, a tenant of her aunt's boarding house. Richards was a genius and a brilliant scientist. He was attending Columbia University at the time.\n     Many years passed before Sue and Reed finally crossed paths again. In an attempt to become an actress, young Susan went to California to pursue acting and met up with Reed once again. Reed was taken by the woman Susan had become and shortly afterward they began dating.\n     Around this time, Reed was trying to accomplish his lifelong dream of building a spaceship, which he funded with his own money along with government grants. The government threatened to cut off funding as it was tiring of what they considered to be Reed's overly fastidious preparations. Desperate to try out the ship, Reed took his best friend and test pilot Ben Grimm, Sue, and Johnny on an unauthorized trip into outer space. They had all helped in the design, but the ship did not have adequate shielding and they were bombarded by cosmic rays. The ship was forced back into Earth's atmosphere and crashed-landed. The four discovered that the cosmic rays had mutated them and given them superhuman abilities. They decided to use their powers to fight evil and became the Fantastic Four. \n\nPowers and Abilities:\nForce Fields:\n     Sue can now generate and control a form of energy from hyperspace. She bends light waves away from her which make her invisible. She also wears a special suit which has unstable molecules. This special suit allows her clothes to become invisible with her as well. Soon after, she was able to render other objects invisible. By rendering objects invisible, she uses her imagination rather than visuals. For example, she can make pipes in a building invisible without actually seeing them. With this, she could also disrupt the energy waves making someone else invisible. She could also make invisible objects and use them a projectiles, something small being much like a bullet and something large like a battering ram. With this, she could make a temporary ladder or something which she could use to reach higher places. She also has the ability to form force fields around her and other people. She can control the texture of these force fields, making them as tough as she wants or as soft. She can also fly or levitate by pushing her energy through air molecules. Can also assimilate telekinesis which developed to the point that she destroyed a piece of a Celestial's armor.\n     Sue's powers have grown and she's learned to use them in new and creative ways.\nWith her invisibility she can.\n1.render all of herself, or any part of herself invisible\n2.render others and other objects invisible and make walls, the floor, or the ceiling, invisible so she can see through them\n3.sense other things that are invisible and make them visible\n4.partially disguise her clothing to modify her appearance (notably hiding her costume when posing as a civilian.)\nWith her force fields she can...\n1.create strong shields\n2.Create ladders, bridges, platforms, elevators and other things to get places\n3.Create a board or saucer to levitate herself or others\n4.use her force fields to move things (like telekinesis)\n5.create Weapons (i.e. a sword)\n6.create a projectile weapon\n7.create a battering ram (to bust open doors, etc)\n8.create something soft to catch someone (like a giant glove or mattress)\n9.make things explode by creating a shield inside of it then expanding it\n10.suffocate someone by putting them in a shield and not letting air in\n11.create an air bubble, she can go places without air and not let air out\n     She has had some training in hand to hand combat, and is a capable unarmed combatant.",

                    "     Benjamin Jacob Grimm was born on Yancy Street in the heart of New York City into a poor Jewish family. When Ben was a young kid his older brother, Daniel Grimm, was the leader of the Yancy Street Gang, a group of young trouble-makers from the area. When he was old enough Ben joined this gang as well. He was inducted into the gang by being beaten in. Growing up poor along with his gang affiliation and related activities made Ben street-smart, tough and 'hard' very early in life. All of these personality characteristics have served him well throughout his lifetime of brawling and adventuring.\n     Ben did well in high school, using his natural talent to his advantage becoming an excellent football player, Ben won an athletic scholarship to Empire State University where he met, roomed and became best friends with Reed Richards. While attending university Ben and Reed also meet Victor Von Doom who was studying there as well.\n     After college, Ben joined the US Air Force and became a fantastic pilot, often testing experimental aircraft and even flying top secret missions for the US government. His piloting skills eventually landed him a spot at NASA.\n     Ben was later contacted by his old friend Reed who wanted him to pilot his experimental rocket into space . Ben was reluctant to pilot the ship as he was unsure that it would be safe for them. Ben was persuaded to do so anyway and they took off with Susan Storm, who helped fund the project, and her younger brother Johnny.\n     Still not cleared for takeoff, Ben took off at the others request and they made their fateful trip into outer space. Unfortunately, Ben was right to assume the safety risks, and the ship was bombarded with cosmic rays. When the rocket ship eventually crash-landed back on Earth the crew saw Sue briefly disappear when as turned invisible. This caused Ben to get angry with and aggressive towards Reed which triggered a radical physical tranformation causing Ben to suddenly changed into a monstrous thing. Ben tried to attack Reed, but Reed transformed into Mr. Fantastic, using his lengthy arms to wrap them around Ben. Johnny then suddenly changed into the Human Torch. Reed gathered the group together and convinced them that they must use their powers to help mankind. Thus the Fantastic Four was formed, though Ben was somewhat reluctant. By the way, it was Susan Storm who first called Ben a Thing and so when it came time for each member of the team to choose names, Ben decided to go with the name that Susan had already given him. This must have been Ben's way of getting back a little at Reed and Sue, for their being at least partially responsible for his tragic transformation.\n     It must be mentioned that Ben did not want to pilot the rocketship and only did so because Susan Storm called him a coward. Hence, in a very real sense, Susan is just as much to blame for the Thing's condition as Reed Richards. It's also possible that Susan's goading worked on Ben because had strong emotional feelings (possibly love) for her. It is rather strange that Stan Lee only saddled Reed Richards with guilt over Ben Grimm becoming the Thing, when Susan Storm was the one that really got Ben to agree to pilot the ship. One would think that Susan Storm would also have been crushed with guilt through the years for her part in Ben Grimm transforming into the Thing, but such was not to be the case. As for Ben's romantic feelings for Sue, despite the fact that the FF Bullpen claimed for a long time that Ben was no longer in love with Sue, they were eventually proved wrong. When Mr. Fantastic and Doctor Doom went missing and presumed dead, Ben actually wondered to himself if he might finally have a chance with Susan.\n     Ben remained a reliable member of the team, but was constantly shunned and often dwelled on his monstrous appearance, usually trying to make jokes about it to keep his spirits high. Although he considered himself deformed, his transformation gave Ben incredible strength and durability, making him the physical powerhouse of the team. Reed blamed Ben's appearance on himself and swore to cure Ben one way or the other. Ben would often wear a trench coat and hat to cover himself up to avoid scaring anyone or people gawking at his appearance. He soon started a love/hate relationship with Johny storm, saying that at one time he could kill him for being annoying as heck, and other times seeing him as the best pal or the best younger brother a guy could have.\n     Ben developed a different point of view about his problem when he met the blind sculptress Alicia Masters. She loved Ben for Ben, not his appearance. This made Ben believe that she actually loved him not as a man but as a rocky hided monster and made him subconsciously averse to reverting to his original human form. Ben and Alicia's relationship went on for a long time, surviving many turbulent ups and downs such as the alien Silver Surfer forming a bond with Alicia when he first arrived on Earth, multiple attacks on Ben by Alicia's step-father Phillip Masters (a.k.a. the Puppet Master) who did not approve of their love and Ben's own insecurities based on deep-seated underlying doubts of his worthiness of Alicia's affections and fear of her leaving him because he was the monstrous looking Thing while at the same time secretly believing she would only love him as the Thing not as Ben Grimm the normal man if he were ever finally cured. Eventually Ben and Alicia's relationship did end when Ben stayed behind on Battleworld for some personal introspection and exploration at the end of the first Secret War.\n     When Reed and Sue were married and had a son named Franklin, they asked Ben to become the child's Godfather. Ben was very honored that they choose him. He became known to Franklin as Uncle Ben.\n     Through the years Ben has had innumerable adventures with not only his teammates but many, many other heroes, super-beings and even aliens throughout the Marvel Universe. In the course of these adventures and team-ups, Ben has made many acquaintance and friends including Justice, whom Ben met while defending the boy against his future-self from the 30th century, Goliath (Bill Foster) whom Ben convinced to stop calling himself Black Goliath, Quasar, the future Protector of the Universe who was then director of security for Project Pegasus, Skull the slayer; whom Ben talked into returning to the present to clear his name and even an earlier, alternate universe version of himself. Ben also encountered and/or teamed up with old sparring partners like the Hulk, Namor the Sub-Mariner, Black Bolt, Power Man, Nick Fury andSilver Surfer while establishing new sparring partners such as Wonder Man, Sasquatch and Hyperion. He also teamed with many of the highest profile heroes including Captain America, Spider-Man, Thor, Iron Man,Daredevil and Dr. Strange. Ben faced and fought foes ranging from the most obscure all the way to universal threats like Thanos. The time spent with these many and varied members of the superhero community has built bonds of trust and friendship for Ben that have enhanced his reputation as one of the most honest and dependable superheroes anywhere, despite his monstrous appearance. A great many of these friendships have served him well and endure to this very day.\n\nPowers and abilities:\n     As a result of a mutagenic effect due to exposure to cosmic radiation, the Thing possesses high levels of superhuman strength, stamina, and resistance to physical injury. His strength has continued to increase over the years due to a combination of further mutation and special exercise equipment designed for him by Reed Richards.\n     He is capable of surviving impacts of great strength and force without sustaining injury, as his body is covered with an orange, flexible, rock-like hide. He is also able to withstand gunfire from high caliber weapons as well as armor piercing rounds. It is possible to breach his exterior, however, and he does bleed as a result. The Thing's highly advanced musculature generates fewer fatigue toxins during physical activity, granting him superhuman levels of stamina. When in his Thing form, he has only three fingers and a thumb on each hand. The loss of one digit on each hand, and the increase in volume of the remainder, does not affect his manual dexterity. However, he has been shown doing things like holding a pencil and using it to dial a phone, or to push buttons on a keypad, to demonstrate how he adapts to using devices that would ordinarily be too small for him.\n     Aside from his physical attributes, the Thing's senses can withstand greater levels of sensory stimulation than an ordinary human, with the exception of his sense of touch. His lungs possess greater efficiency and volume than those of an ordinary human. As a result, the Thing is capable of holding his breath for much greater periods of time.\n     Despite his brutish, even monstrous form, the Thing suffers no change in his personality nor his level of intelligence. Despite his greatly increased size, the Thing's agility and reflexes remain at the same level they had been prior to his transformation.\n     The Thing is an exceptionally skilled pilot, due to his time spent as a test pilot in the United States Air Force and as a founding member of the Fantastic Four. He is also a formidable and relentless hand-to-hand combatant. His fighting style incorporates elements of boxing, wrestling, judo, jujutsu, and street-fighting techniques, as well as hand-to-hand combat training from the military.\n     After an encounter with the Grey Gargoyle, the Thing seemed to have gained the ability to shift between his human and rock forms at will.That ability has since been lost when it was discovered that he created versions of himself in other universes whenever he transformed.\n     On occasion, when Ben Grimm regained his human form and lost his Thing powers, he used a suit of powered battle armor designed by Reed Richards that simulated the strength and durability of his mutated body, albeit to a weaker degree. Wearing the suit, which was designed to physically resemble his rocky form, Ben continued to participate in the Fantastic Four's adventures. The first exo-skeletal Thing suit was destroyed after Galactus restored Ben's natural powers and form. A second suit was built and used sporadically when Ben had been returned to his human form.\n     It has been revealed - after Franklin and Valeria created a formula that allows Ben to become human for one week each year - that Ben is almost immortal when in his Thing form, as he only ages when he is human, Reed and Nathaniel travelling over two thousand years into the future to see Ben still alive after all that time.",

                    "Peter Benjamin Parker was born to C.I.A. agents Richard and Mary Parker, who were killed when Peter was very young. After the death of his parents, Peter was raised by his Uncle Ben and Aunt May",
                    "     Peter Benjamin Parker was born to C.I.A. agents Richard and Mary Parker, who were killed when Peter was very young. After the death of his parents, Peter was raised by his Uncle Ben and Aunt May in a modest house in Forest Hills, New York. While still in High School, Peter attended a science exhibition about radiology where he was bitten by a radioactive spider, granting him the proportionate strength and agility of a spider as well as a Spider-Sense that warns him of nearby danger. In order to test his new abilities and earn some cash, Peter participated in a wrestling challenge against Crusher Hogan. He easily won the challenge and also gained the attention of the media. Afterwards while backstage, Peter saw a burglar run past him but did nothing to stop him as it wasnt his problem. Later that night when Peter arrived home, he was told by a policeman that his Uncle Ben had been murdered by someone who broke into their house. The cop mentioned they had tracked the killer to a warehouse. In his anger Peter put on his wrestling costume and went after the murderer himself. After arriving at the warehouse and easily defeating Uncle Ben's killer, Peter saw that it was the same burglar he didn't stop at the arena thus learning that with great power comes great responsibility..\n     Despite his superpowers, Parker struggles to help his widowed aunt pay rent, is taunted by his peers particularly football star Flash Thompson and, as Spider-Man, engenders the editorial wrath of newspaper publisher J. Jonah Jameson.As he battles his enemies for the first time, Parker finds juggling his personal life and costumed adventures difficult. In time, Peter graduates from high school,and enrolls atEmpire State University where he meets roommate and best friend Harry Osborn, and girlfriendGwen Stacy,and Aunt May introduces him to Mary Jane Watson.As Peter deals with Harry's drug problems, and Harry's father is revealed to be Spider-Man's nemesis the Green Goblin, Peter even attempts to give up his costumed identity for a while.\n     Gwen Stacy's father,New York City Police detective captain George Stacy is accidentally killed during a battle between Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus In the course of his adventures Spider-Man has made a wide variety of friends and contacts within the superhero community, who often come to his aid when he faces problems that he cannot solve on his own.\n     The Green Goblin throws Gwen Stacy from a tower of the George Washington Bridge.She dies during Spider-Man's rescue attempt.The battle Goblin also kills himself accidentally in the ensuing battle with Spider-Man.\n     Working through his grief, Parker eventually develops tentative feelings toward Watson, and the two become confidants rather than lovers. A romantic relationship eventually develops, with Parker proposing her, and being turned down by her.Parker went on to graduate from college and becomes involved with the shy Debra Whitman and the extroverted, flirtatious costumed thief Felicia Hardy, the Black Cat.\n     Spider-Man then wore a black costume with a white spider design on his chest consisting of alien symbiote which Spider-Man is able to reject after a difficult struggle, though the symbiote returns several times as Venom for revenge. \n     Parker proposes to Watson a second time, and she accepts the proposal.Then Peter becomes convinced that Ben Reilly, the Scarlet Spider (a clone of Peter created by his college professor Miles Warren) is the real Peter Parker, and that he, Peter, is the clone. Peter gives up the Spider-Man identity to Reilly for a time, until Reilly is killed by the returning Green Goblin and revealed to be the clone after all. He develops additional spider-like abilities including biological web-shooters, toxic stingers that extend from his forearms, the ability to stick individuals to his back, enhanced Spider-sense and night vision, and increased strength and speed. Peter later becomes a member of the New Avengers, and Parker's identity was he revealed  to his teammates in the New Avengers and his friends in the Fantastic Four, and others have deduced it. Parker's Aunt May married J. Jonah Jameson's father, Jay Jameson. Jonah himself has been elected Mayor of New York City, and Parker became an employee of the think-tank Horizon Labs.\n     Finally, Peter Parker, the original Spider-Man, had his mind swapped with Doctor Octopus and eventually died in Otto Octavius's decaying body. At the end of their epic final battle, Peter managed to use their shared memories to show Otto what it means to be a hero -- what it means to be Spider-Man. Realizing how difficult it really is to be Spider-Man, Otto immediately regretted his actions. However it was too late and after Peter Parker's passing, Doctor Octopus vowed to become an even Superior Spider-Man. Peter now follows the new Spider-Man in spirit form, doing his best to prevent Doctor Octopus from destroying his life until he finds a way to return to his body.\n     \nPowers and Abilities:\n     Spider-Man possesses the proportionate powers of a spider, granted to him from an irradiated Common House Spider which bit Peter Parker that was apparently already mutated from prior exposure to certain frequencies of radiation and received a final, lethal dose during Parker's attendance of the exhibition.\n     The radioactive, complex mutagenic enzymes in the spider's blood that were transferred at the time of the bite triggered numerous body-wide mutagenic changes within Parker, granting him superhuman strength, speed, toughened flesh, and numerous arachnid-like abilities. Like many superhuman powers, the effectiveness of Spider-Man's abilities varies based on the author and the needs of the story.\nSpider-Sense:\n     Spider-Man has many abilities but the most amazing of all is his uncanny Spider-Sense. It is a tingling sensation on the back of his skull that acts as a sixth sense and it manifests when he is around or targeted by incoming dangers. It's a precognition ability that is pheromone based and is similar to Daredevil's radar sense, increasing his reaction time and awareness. The spider-sense can manifest when Peter's secret identity is about to be compromised. It also manifests when he encounters someone who might pose a threat to him or to someone he cares about. While the spider-sense cannot discern the specific nature of the impending threat, he can identify which direction it is coming from and the severity of the danger by the intensity of the spider-sense. Sometimes it becomes strong enough to be painful. When Spider-Man is blinded, the Spider-Sense works as another set of eyes to avoid bumping into objects. Under extreme circumstances, such as fighting in the dark or against powerful characters, Spidey has often used his spectacular spider-sense in a more effective and better way. The Spider-Sense also gave him his own free-style form of combat, allowing him to go head-to-head with the best martial artists in the Marvel Universe and his H2H skill has improved significantly since merging his Way of the Spider training with his Spider-Sense.\n     Furthermore, the Spider-Sense also allows Spider-Man to detect certain radio frequencies on which his spider tracers' signals are based upon.The Spider-Sense, combined with his speed and reflexes allows Spider-Man to dodge almost all conventional attacks. Due to the similar nature of their powers, Spider-Man is unable to sense other Spiders, such as Ben Reilly, Ezekiel, and Kaine\nSuperhuman Strength:\n     Spider-Man has the proportionate strength of a spider, thus allowing him to press 10 tons without effort and much more when under stress. His attacks are so strong; they could kill a normal person- Spider-Man has to pull his punches or kicks when not fighting foes with similar or higher strength levels to avoid fatalities. His strength also extends to his feet, allowing him to leap great lengths and attain a heights of much greater three stories with one powerful jump. Superhuman Speed, Agility, Flexibility and Reflexes\n     Spider-Man possesses the uncanny speed, agility and reflexes of a spider. He can move at a speed that surpasses that of the finest human athletes. This is particularly evident over short distances. He has frequently speed-blitzed many foes- including those with enhanced speed and reflexes, moving so fast that he leaves blurring after images.\n     Spider-Man can easily perform the most complicated acrobatic moves as his body is extremely flexible, giving him agility, balance and bodily coordination that surpass those of the finest human athletes. Spider-Man is considered the best when it comes to balance in the Marvel Universe, as he possesses excellent equilibrium allowing him to balance himself on any object.\n     Spider-Man's reflexes are forty times greater than peak level humans, and when combined with his Spider-Sense, speed and agility, enable him to dodge bullets and other conventional projectiles with ease. \nSuperhuman Durability:\n     Spider-Man also has incredible durability to blunt trauma as his body is much tougher than that of a normal person. He can withstand such levels of damage and punishment that would kill non-super powered individuals. This durability extends to falling from great heights. His durability to blunt trauma also extends to explosive forces, and he has taken explosions with the force of a hand grenade and recovered nearly instantly in a recent fight with the Juggernaut. However, Spider-Man's durability isn't nearly as formidable against penetrative forces. He can be hurt by knives and bullets much in the same way that normal humans can, and has been rendered unconscious by a tracking bullet which pierced his shoulder. Normal bullets also tend to cause Spider-Man problems as well.However, if injured by such forces, Spider-Man healing factor allows him to heal much faster than normal humans can.\nWall Crawling\n     Spider-Man's exposure to the mutated spider venom induced a mutagenic, cerebellum-wide alteration of his engrams resulting in the ability to mentally control the flux of inter-atomic attraction (electrostatic force) between molecular boundary layers. This overcomes the outer electron shell's normal behavior of mutual repulsion with other outer electron shells and permits the tremendous potential for electron attraction to prevail. This ability to affect the attraction between surfaces is so far limited to Spider-Man's body (especially concentrated in his hands and feet) and another object, with an upper limit of several tons per finger. Spider-man utilizes this ability in his locomotion across New-York. It also works differently, ripping off layers of skin and muscle, rather than burning it as Kaine does via the HCL secreted through his palms.\nOrganic Webbing:\n     Spider-Man has organic webbing, which is often shown as being stronger and more long lasting than his synthetic variants. The strength of his webbing relates directly to his health.\nSuperhuman Stamina:\n     Spider-Man's advanced musculature produces less fatigue toxins during physical activity than an ordinary human. This allows him to exert himself physically for much longer periods of time before fatigue begins to impair him.At his peak, Spider-Man can physically exert himself at his peak capacity for many hours before the build up of fatigue toxins in his blood begins to impair him. \nRegenerative Healing Factor:\n     Spider-Man has a limited healing factor. While not on Wolverine's level, it is sufficiently powerful enough to recover from severe injuries from broken bones and large amounts of tissue damage in a matter of days. After getting his powers, he soon found that his eyesight was repaired, discarding his glasses. \nForeign Chemical Resistance:\n     Due to his accelerated metabolism, Spider-Man has a higher tolerance for drugs and diseases than normal humans, and he can recover from the effects of larger doses rapidly. His resistance and recovery time to other toxins and diseases varies, but is typically significantly higher than normal. Spider-Man's unique physiology even allowed him to recover from the effects of vampirism. Spider-Man was able to recover completely from acid being spat into his eyes by the new Vulture. However, Spider-Man has the normal human tolerance for alcoholic beverages.\nSuperhuman Sight:\n     Spider-Man also seems to have at least some degree of Super-Human sight, at least in order to assist his Superhuman speed, reflexes and agility. Ever since obtaining his powers, he has not needed his glasses, and has frequently pulled off impressive aiming feats with his webbing, although this is assisted with his Spider-Sense.\nSkills:\n     On top of his spider-given powers Peter is of genius level intelligence. It has even been stated that Peter scored as high on some of the same testing scores as Reed Richards did when he was Peter's age. He is especially gifted in the sciences such as mechanics, biology and physics.\n     He has built many devices in his career as Spider-Man and is a skilled photographer and teacher. He has developed a unique style of combat through the years. Spider-Man, even before his training from Shang-Chi, has gone toe to toe with even the best marvel fighters. His spider-sense alone is like a close combat expert and combined with Spider-Man's reflexes and physical attributes, make it very difficult for Street-levelers to defeat him when he is not holding back.",

                    "Harry James Potter (born 31 July 1980) was a half-blood wizard, the only child and son of James Potter and Lily Potter , and one of the most famous wizards of modern times. In what proved to be a vain attempt to circumvent a prophecy",
                    "     Harry James Potter (born 31 July 1980) was a half-blood wizard, the only child and son of James Potter and Lily Potter , and one of the most famous wizards of modern times. In what proved to be a vain attempt to circumvent a prophecy that a boy born at the end of July of 1980 could be able to defeat him, Voldemort attempted to murder him when he was a year and three months old, shortly after murdering Harry's parents as they tried to protect him. This early, unsuccessful attempt to vanquish Harry led to Voldemort's first defeat and the end of the First Wizarding War. One consequence of Lily's protection is that her orphaned son had to be raised by her only remaining blood relative, Petunia Dursley, where he was neither welcomed nor nurtured, but would stay alive, at least until he was seventeen years old. As the only known survivor of the Killing Curseup to that point, Harry was already famous before he arrived at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\n     Early on his eleventh birthday, Harry learned that he was a wizard. He began attending Hogwarts in 1991 and was Sorted into Gryffindorhouse. While at school, Harry became best friends with Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger, and later  became the youngestQuidditch Seeker in over a century and eventually captain of his house's team, winning two Quidditch Cups. He became even better known in his early years for protecting the Philosopher's Stone from Voldemort and saving Ron's sister Ginny Weasley from the Chamber of Secrets. In his fourth year, Harry won the Triwizard Tournament, although the competition ended in tragedy with the death of Cedric Diggory and the return of Voldemort. The next school year, Harry reluctantly founded Dumbledore's Army and fought in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, during which he lost his godfather,Sirius Black, who was a father figure to him.\n     Harry played a significant role in many other battles of the Second Wizarding War and hunted down and destroyed Voldemort'sHorcruxes with Ron and Hermione. During the Battle of Hogwarts, he personally witnessed the deaths of Severus Snape and Fred Weasley, and learned that Remus Lupin, Nymphadora Tonks, Colin Creevey, and many others had fallen as well. He encountered Voldemort and sacrificed himself, knowing that his doing so was the only way to destroy the fragment of Voldemort's soul that was inside him. In Harry's near-death experience after Voldemort cursed him in the forest clearing, Dumbledore gave Harry advice and background information on Voldemort. When told he could choose to live or to move on, Harry chose to live, and after he awoke he confronted Voldemort, and defeated him.\n     Harry is also notable for being the only known Master of Death, having united the three Deathly Hallows.After the war, Harry became an Auror and married Ginny Weasley, with whom he had three children: James Sirius who he named after his father and godfather, Albus Severus, named after Snape and Dumbledore, and Lily Luna, named after his mother and good friend Luna Lovegood. Harry was also named the godfather of Teddy Lupin. He became Head of the Auror Office in 2007, and occasionally went to Hogwarts to deliver Defence Against the Dark Arts lectures\n\nMagical abilities and skills:\n     Harry was seen and had proven himself to be a very talented and powerful wizard, with many of his strengths being praised by witches and wizards much older and wiser than he was. His power is evident from the begining of the series; specifically, Harry shows immediate command of a broomstick, produces a Patronus at an early age, and survives several encounters with Lord Voldemort.\nLove:\n     Harry's greatest power of all was his ability to love. In spite of being raised by a family that treated him with anything but affection, Harry remarkably turned out capable of very strong love. His love for his friends caused him to feel no concern for his own well being or happiness when they were at risk, and put himself in danger many times to protect them. Harry's ability to love also protected and helped him on several occasions, such as when he defeated Quirrell by causing his skin to burn (due to the magical protection from his mother's sacrifice), produced a Patronus that could drive numerous Dementors away, repelled Voldemort himself when he possessed him, and allowed him to close the connection between him and Voldemort when he was unable to perform Occlumency. His love was strongest when directed at Ginny Weasley, who was the driving force that kept him going until Voldemort was defeated.\nDefence Against the Dark Arts:\n      Harry was extremely adept in Defence Against the Dark Arts, having mastered all manners of jinxes and spells, such as the Stunning Spell, Disarming Charm, Impediment Jinx and Reductor Curse. In fact, his Stunning Spell was so strong that opponents would get knocked out if they were hit directly. Harry also achieved an Outstanding Defence Against the Dark Arts O.W.L., something that not even Hermione achieved, a testament of his extraordinary talent in defensive magic. Indeed, Harry was so good at D.A.D.A. that when the Ministry of Magic prevented the subject from being taught effectively in 1995, Harry set up his own D.A.D.A. club and successfully taught the members to defend themselves well against the Dark Arts. Harry had also developed a high level of resistance to the Imperius Curse, demonstrated when it was first cast upon him by Barty Crouch Jr. (disguised as Alastor Moody) during a Defence Against the Dark Arts class in his fourth year. Crouch cursed Harry with it four times in a row, until he could throw it off entirely. At the end of the school year, Voldemort himself cast the Imperius Curse on Harry, which he was able to resist, much to the astonishment of the Death Eaters who were present. Harry's natural aptitude for resisting the Imperius Curse, and ability to resist it when cast by the most powerful Dark Wizard in history, demonstrates an indescribable strength of will and character.\nDuelling:\n      Despite his young age, Harry was an accomplished and skillful duellist, being able to single-handedly defeat Death Eaters and even survive numerous encounters with Lord Voldemort himself. He eventually defeated Voldemort by becoming the master of the Elder Wand. In many battles of the Second Wizarding War, he was able to incapacitate much more experienced Death Eaters, and during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, he was the only one of the six D.A. members to be neither injured nor incapacitated and, along with Albus Dumbledore and Remus Lupin, was the only fighter on their side to emerge from the battle physically unscathed, and in that time he had defeated Lucius Malfoy and had defeated the extremely powerful Antonin Dolohov twice. Later, in the same battle, he was able to hold his own against Bellatrix Lestrange, who was the most powerful of all the Death Eaters. In 1997, Harry defeated Yaxley, Fenrir Greyback, and one of the two Carrows. He fought off several Death Eaters in the Battle of the Seven Potters, defeated Thorfinn Rowle with a single spell during the Luchino Caffe Duel, knocked out Yaxley and Dolores Umbridge during the Infiltration of the Ministry of Magic, overpowered Lucius Malfoy, Draco Malfoy and Fenrir Greyback during the Skirmish at Malfoy Manor, and avoided direct conflict damage all throughout the Battle of Hogwarts (ensuring that mastery of the Elder Wand did not waver from him). He was known to be very quick off the draw and had an aggressive duelling style, even incorporating Unforgivable Curses. He was also known to taunt his opponents and get them to talk at length, angering them and throwing them mentally off-balance, buying himself time to strategise or lulling them into lowering their guard. Harry was especially skilled in the Disarming Charm, and used it so much that it was seen as his signature spell by many Death Eaters. His most notable uses of the Disarming Charm were when he formed Priori Incantatem with Voldemort and when he finally killed the Dark Lord. At the remarkably young age of seventeen, Harry became an Auror, and in 2007, was promoted to Head of the Auror Office.\nDark Arts:\n     Harry was one of the few non-Dark Wizards who was highly proficient in the Dark Arts at all levels; whilst he knew simple curses and jinxes like the Furnunculus Curse, Flipendo and the Impediment Jinx, he could use more powerful spells such as the Blasting Curse. He was also able to flawlessly cast the jinxes and curses in the Half-Blood Prince's coby of Advanced Potion-Making such as; Langlock, Levicorpus, and Sectumsempra. Harry even attempted some of the Unforgivable Curses with varying degrees of success, such as the Imperius Curse on Travers and a goblin called Bogrod during the 1998 Break-in of Gringotts Wizarding Bank, as well as the Cruciatus Curse on several occasions  once on Bellatrix Lestrange in 1996 (though not very successfully), another on Snape in 1997 (at which time he was prevented from completing the incantation) and once more against Amycus Carrow in 1998, (and whilst the curse was more successful than Harry's past attempts, it did not result in the prolonged, excruciating pain that the curse was famous for  instead, Carrow screamed and was incapacitated). However, he has never used the Killing Curse for obvious reasons, even in his final battle with Voldemort.\nFlying:\n      Harry had also inherited his father's talent for flying and for Quidditch, showing immediate command of a broomstick in his first year, which made him a naturally good Seeker. This was the first magical skill for which he discovered an aptitude, as he found in 1991. In fact, at the mere age of eleven, Harry became the youngest Seeker in a century. Harry's extraordinary flying skills aided him when he had to capture Winged Keys to get past Professor Flitwick's challenge in the Philosopher's Stone Chambers, and also helped him in the Triwizard Tournament (where he had to steal a golden egg from a Hungarian Horntail), and during the Battle of Hogwarts, during which he managed to escape a Fiendfyre inferno in the Room of Requirement. \nParselmouth:\n      Because he carried a piece of Voldemort's soul within himself, Harry was able to speak and understand Parseltongue from 1981 to 1998. After that soul fragment was destroyed, Harry lost this ability, which he was glad for.\nInsight into Voldemort's mind:\n      Also due to the piece of Voldemort's soul, Harry was able to look into Voldemort's mind and see through his senses from time to time. He sometimes used this ability to monitor what Voldemort was doing. However, it was a dangerous ability to have as well; Voldemort once used it, along with Legilimency, to plant a false vision in Harry's mind of Sirius Black being tortured, which he used to lure Harry to the Department of Mysteries. Additionally, because of their connection, Harry felt a burning pain in his scar whenever he and Voldemort were in close proximity or whenever Voldemort felt strong negative emotions. Although Harry failed to learn Occlumency, he did eventually have some success at blocking his connection to Voldemort by focusing on feelings of grief, even though Albus Dumbledore told Harry it was love. As Harry lost the ability to speak Parseltongue, he presumably lost this ability as well when the soul fragment within him was destroyed, as was Voldemort himself.\nMaster of the Deathly Hallows:\n     Harry was master of all three of the Deathly Hallows for a time. Harry overpowered and disarmed Draco Malfoy during a skirmish at Malfoy Manor. Because Draco was unknowingly the master of the Elder Wand, which he had taken from previous owner Albus Dumbledore, the wand's allegiance turned to Harry when he disarmed him, although the wand was in Voldemort's possession at the time. Dumbledore left the Resurrection Stone to Harry in his will, contained in the Golden Snitch that Harry had caught during his very first Quidditch match. The Cloak of Invisibility was rightfully Harry's, as it was passed down to him through the generations of the Potter family from its original owner, Ignotus Peverell, who was Harry's ancestor. The Resurrection Stone was lost in the Forbidden Forest in 1998, while Harry returned the Elder Wand to Dumbledore's tomb that same year. Harry kept the Invisibility Cloak, as it was a priceless family heirloom.\nPotions: \n     His Potions ability was apparently better than it appeared, as he was able to achieve an Exceeds Expectations grade on his O.W.L. exam. He was only one of twelve students able to advance to N.E.W.T.-level. He improved greatly during his sixth year when he came into possession of an old potions textbook in which a talented former student (Severus Snape) had revised many potion-making techniques. However, the usage of this textbook was noted by both Hermione and Snape to be cheating, and when forced to hide it, Harry's potion skills suffered. Despite this, it is noted that Harry had no problems with potions at all, as long as Snape was not around.\nTransfiguration: \n     Harry was able to advance to N.E.W.T.-level Transfiguration. He achieved an Exceeds Expectations on his O.W.L. exam. During his sixth year he was able to conjure ropes and water. In 1995 he vanished the whole of an iguana and in 1997 a snake that crossed his path. He is also skilled enough to perform Human Transfiguration, which is noted to be very difficult. He accomplished this during a 1996 Transfiguration lesson where he succeeded in turning his eyebrow bright yellow. Minerva McGonagall herself complimented Harry on his Transfiguration ability.\nCharms:\n     Harry was rather good at the subject and achieved an Exceeds Expectations in his Charms work. He frequently used the Summoning Charm successfully, would occasionally cast the protective enchantments that Hermione would use during the Horcrux hunt, and was able to cast the Confundus Charm. He also displayed an impressive mastery of the Shield Charm surpassing that of many Ministry employees. Under the teaching of Remus Lupin, Harry was able to cast a corporeal Patronus Charm in his third year, which was a remarkable feat and yet another proof of his talent, given that many adult wizards were unable to cast the difficult charm successfully. His Patronus took the form of a stag, his father's Animagus and Patronus form. Harry's Patronus was so powerful that, even at the very first time he successfully cast it against true Dementors, it was able to drive away hundreds of Dementors.\nHealing spells:\n     Harry was able to use healing spells. He fixed Demelza Robins broken lip in 1996 with a spell used to treat mild to moderate injuries. He also uesd the healing spell for clearing up dried blood from a bleeding wound. But instead of clearing up dried blood he used it to siphon off dust from an old photo.\nApparition:\n     Harry had not earned a license to apparate but he used the ability frequently during 1997 and 1998 to great success, even when forced to apparate with only a few seconds notice or while guiding others. Harry used apparition in his sixth year to a very impressive degree to get himself and a weakened Albus Dumbledore over an incredibly vast distance even though he was inexperienced. Harry has stated and it is noted that he does not like the sensation however.\nNon-verbal and wandless magic: \n     In 1995, when the Dementors attacked in Little Whinging, Dudley had knocked Harry's wand out of his hand when he punched him moments before. In desperation, Harry calls out Lumos! Although his wand was not in his hand, the wand tip lit up. During 1997 and 1998, Harry began using spells non-verbally and became quite proficient at it when Snape wasn't bothering him. He used both non-verbal and wandless magic in 1991, when he caused the glass window of a snake's cage at the zoo to vanish and again in 1993 when he inflated Marge Dursley, although both of these occurrences were accidents fuelled by pure anger. Few other wizards have exhibited this power, although Dumbledore and Voldemort were among them. This further contributes to Harry's skill, as only some of the most powerful wizards of his time were able to do so.\nCare of Magical Creatures:\n     Harry has shown on more than one occasion to have good skill in handling numerous sorts of magical creatures. For example, he was the first in his class to tame a Hippogriff, which he did very excellently. He befriended the Hippogriff, Buckbeak, to the extent that Buckbeak defended him when he was in danger. He has also shown on three occasions that he is quite competent at dealing with dragons. This is shown when he was able to help Hagrid take care of baby Norbert the dragon, outsmart the Hungarian Horntail in the Triwizard Tournament, and tame a half-blind dragon into helping them escape Gringotts by flying out on its back. Harry is also very skilled at dealing with Dementors, so well that the first time he was able to drive away hundreds of dementors. Harry was also good at dealing with house-elves, befriending the house-elf Dobby and eventually freeing him, which made the little elf so loyal to him that he gave his life to save him. He also earned the respect and loyalty of Kreacher, a very difficult task.\nHerbology:\n      Harry attended N.E.W.T. Herbology classes. He earned an Exceeds Expectations on his O.W.L. exam, showing some aptitude in the subject.\nExpert detective skills:\n      Harry, along with Ron and Hermione, was also a formidably talented investigator. While in school, the trio had a knack for solving difficult mysteries and discovering the truth despite all attempts by others to conceal it, with Hermione generally finding the background information while Harry put the pieces together to make a coherent picture. In his first year, Harry uncovered the truth about the Philosopher's Stone and saved it from Voldemort. Over the next six years, he would solve the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets, learn of Sirius's innocence and Pettigrew's betrayal, find the truth about the Prophecy, and hunt down and destroy all of Voldemort's Horcruxes using his amazing deductive skills. Harry's deductive skills also allowed him to uncover the mystery of the Deathly Hallows and learn that he mastered the three of them. Harry also had a knack for spotting things that others did not, and had a sharp eye for details, as he was able to tell that Luna Lovegood had not been home in weeks by the state of her room, and he became suspicious when Dobby revealed that he had known that Harry was not getting any letters in 1992. His intelligence allowed him to intuitively know that Draco Malfoy had been branded with the Dark Mark despite no solid proof, that Malfoy was using the Room of Requirement as a work shop, and that he was having Crabbe and Goyle use Polyjuice Potion in order to disguise themselves as girls while keeping watch outside the room.\nLeadership:\n     While Harry never deliberately set out to be a leader to others, he has often taken charge when the situation required it, beginning with his impulsive decision to find and warn Hermione about the presence of a troll in the school during the 1991 Halloween feast and progressing to the point where over thirty students  some of them in their sixth and seventh years  respected him as a teacher in Dumbledore's Army despite his being younger than they were. Dumbledore later noted that Harry was a superior leader to him as Dumbledore had deliberately sought power in his youth  and subsequently avoided anything more demanding than his role as Hogwarts headmaster  while Harry had leadership thrust upon him and accepted the burden, acknowledging his responsibilities towards those who 'followed' him regardless of how uncomfortable he might feel about the prospect and coordinating his efforts against his enemies well when left with no other option but to take control.\nIndomitable will:\n     Harry appears to possess an unbreakable spirit and, though not above depression, he has never truly given up on any mission. He's been shown to rise from defeat and loss, such as the deaths of many loved ones, even stronger than before. His indomitable will is exemplified by his ability to resist the Imperius Curse, and also by the fact that he's never begged for mercy when in life and death situations, but fights back in defiance, as well as perform non-verbal spells flawlessly. His inability to perform Occlumency, despite possessing the required willpower, is due to his inability to keep his emotions under control at times, and only once, during his lessons with Snape, did he managed to slightly escape Legilimency, but faltered again in the subsequent attempt.\nTeaching skills:\n     Harry has shown tremendous skills in teaching others. Having mastered many spells at a young age, Harry successfully passed them onto others even when he was still a student himself, giving proper instructions and corrections on how to perform many fields of magic, ranging from the relatively simplistic Disarming Charm to the highly advanced Patronus Charm. Harry's effectiveness as a teacher led many, some even older than him, to choose him over a Ministry-installed professional, and he even returned to Hogwarts to give occasional lectures.",

                    "Hellboy is a creature, summoned in the final months of World War II by Grigori Rasputinon Tarmagant Island, off the coast of Scotland, having been commissioned by the Nazis to change the tide of war (Project Ragna Rok). ",
                    "     Hellboy is a creature, summoned in the final months of World War II byGrigori Rasputinon Tarmagant Island, off the coast of Scotland, having been commissioned by the Nazis to change the tide of war (Project Ragna Rok). As a direct result of this ritual, he appears on Earth in a fireball in a ruined church in East Bromwich, England, on December 23, 1944. Proving not to be a devil, in the traditional sense, but a devil-like creature with red skin, horns, a tail, and a disproportionately large right hand made of red stone, he is dubbed Hellboy by Professor Trevor Broom Bruttenholm.\n     Taken by the United States armed forces to an Air Force base in New Mexico, Hellboy is raised by the United States Army and by the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense (BPRD), a private organization dedicated to combating occult threats. However, it is not until he eats his first human meal (a meal of pancakes) that he is forever bound to the mortal world.\n     As an adult, Hellboy becomes the primary agent for the BPRD, alongside other human and quasi-human agents that include Kate Corrigan, a professor of folklore at New York University;Abe Sapien, an amphibian humanoid (Ichthyo sapien); Liz Sherman, a young girl pyrokinetic; Roger, an unusually large homunculus; Johann Kraus, the spirit of a medium kept in a containment suit; and Captain Ben Daimio, a special operations soldier that became an Olmec were-jaguar. The latter two have not met Hellboy due to Hellboy's resignation from the Bureau.\n\nPowers and abilities:\n     Hellboy's powers are his superhuman strength, healing factor, and endurance. He also has the innate ability to comprehend ancient and magical languages. The extent of his strength is unclear, but he has torn down a large tree and hurled it at an opponent and has lifted massive stones.Hellboy has a high degree of resilience to injury. He can withstand powerful blows that would severely injure or kill a human. He survived being shot many times in the chest with an MG 42 machine gun before destroying it.\n     He has survived being impaled through the chest with a sword, drowning, severe werewolf mauling, being beaten unconscious with heavy iron tongs, falling from extreme heights, being crushed by boulders, and more Hellboy is immune to all forms of fire and burns, including Liz Sherman's flames, and electrocution. Despite his ability to quickly recover from seemingly mortal wounds, he is far from invulnerable, and can be injured or bloodied by conventional weapons. \n     Hellboy ages very differently from humans. he was two years old but appears to be somewhere between 6 and 10 human years old,the ten-year-old Hellboy appears fully grown. His rapid physical maturation is in contrast to his actual rate of aging however, which seems to be much slower than humans. Throughout the sixty-year span,he does not age beyond the plateau of physical maturity. This mystical aging process is similar to the other demons and supernatural beings that populate Hellboy's world.The lifespan of a Demon or Half-demon range from decades to many thousands of years.\n     In addition to his natural physical abilities, Hellboy carries a variety of items in his utility belt and jacket that can be used against various supernatural forces. He has been known to carry holy relics, horseshoes, various herbs, and hand grenades. Though he commonly carries an oversized revolver, Hellboy freely admits to being a lousy shot and often fights hand-to-hand, preferring to use short-ranged physical weapons like swords, spears, and his massive stone fist over firearms.\n     Hellboy's ultimate power lies dormant within his giant, stone hand.",

                    "Optimus Prime is the leader of the Autobots, a faction of heroic robots from the planet Cybertron who wage their battles to destroy the evil forces of the Decepticons, for control of their homeworld, and by extension",
                    "     Optimus Prime is the leader of the Autobots, a faction of heroic robots from the planet Cybertron who wage their battles to destroy the evil forces of the Decepticons, for control of their homeworld, and by extension, peace in the universe. The immensely kind and compassionate Prime puts all his talent to use to improve the world around him, and has dedicated himself to the protection of all life, particularly the inhabitants of Earth; he will battle his foes with unyielding resolve to uphold this belief. In power and intelligence, Optimus Prime has no equal, known as one of the greatest heroes on both Cybertron and Earth. \n     The original Optimus Prime transforms into a cab over flat-nose truck. The truck's cab transforms into the robot mode of Prime himself, with vast strength and armed with a laser rifle. Within his chest is contained the mystic talisman known as the Autobot Matrix of Leadership (or Creation Matrix), carried by all Autobot leaders and passed down through the ages. The truck's trailer disconnects and transforms into the Combat Deck, a mobile battlestation command headquarters with an Auto-Launcher robot armed with assorted artillery and beam weapons. It can also serve as radio antenna for battlefield communications between the Autobots. The Combat Deck can launch Prime's third component, Roller, a mobile scout buggy that can easily slip behind enemy lines; when Roller is present somewhere, it is as if Prime is there himself. Injury to one component is felt by each of the others, and while Prime could survive the destruction of either, despite the slight degree of autonomy they possess, the Combat Deck and Roller would not be able to survive without him. \n     Additional powers included (somewhat inconsistently) in the animated series and comics are short-range optic blasts, holographic map projections, and deployable hydro-foils designed by Wheeljack which allowed Prime and the other Autobots to traverse bodies of water with ease. One of Prime's more memorable abilities from the animated series was the ability to retract his right hand and replace it with a glowing energon axe\n     One of Prime's most notable characteristics in any form was his adamant commitment to leadership .A tragic constant of the character is his predilection for self-sacrifice - across several continuities, Prime (and later, his modern namesakes) is almost sure to meet his end and later return to life (sometimes more than once\n\nPersonality:\n     Selfless and endlessly courageous, he is the complete opposite of his mortal enemy Megatron. Originally a mere civilian, he was chosen by the Matrix to command, the first in a number of heavy burdens he has been forced to bear. Another is his bringing of the Transformers' conflict to Earth. Every casualty, human or Cybertronian, weighs heavily on his spark. He does not show this side to his soldiers, and he never succumbs to despair. The Autobots need a decisive, charismatic leader, and that is what he gives them. It was that leadership which turned the tide of the Great War.\n     On the battlefield, there are few who rival Optimus Prime's prowess. He is easily the strongest of any Autobot his size, and his ion blaster and his energon-axe are deadly weapons. He would sacrifice his life to protect his fellow Autobots or those under their care, and does so on a regular basis. His compassion for other sentient beings is his only real weakness, and one the Decepticons have taken advantage of time and again... though it's also the source of his strength!Prime carries within him the Matrix of Leadership.\n     Before being rebuilt into a Powermaster, his robot mode split into three components:\nA sentient robot module, the Brain Center.\nA wheeled drone module known as Roller.\nA Combat Deck.\nAlthough Optimus Prime can function as three independent modules, injury to any one module is felt by the other two.\n\nPowers & Weaknesses:\n     Optimus' vehicle mode is usually a semi-truck, but he has also taken the form of a firetruck. He has been known to combine with his trailer or other Autobots to become a super-powerful transformer. In the movie he briefly took the parts of Jetfire to become more powerful. His powers vary, but generally are:\nFlight at vast supersonic speeds\nInvulnerability to the point of spending days in hyperspace. Also able to enter the Earth's atmosphere with ease.\nTakes the form of a semi truck\nHas a power pack in the form of a trailer to his truck\nCan incorporate nearby machines into his body\nCan fire bullets from his hand like machine guns\nCan fire small rockets\nCan summon either an energy axe or an energy enhanced sword from his right arm. In some version, he has a sword from each arm.\nSuperhuman strength to the point of punching Megatron to submission despite Megatron being made up of advanced parts including a Cybertronian tank.",

                    "     Johnny Blaze was the son of a motorcycle stunt rider named Barton Blaze. Working for a man by the name of Crash Simpson, Barton Blaze and his son Johnny became accustomed to the life of a carnival. When Barton Blaze suddenly died, Johnny's world was turned upside down as he lost the last of his family. Not long after the stunt accident that killed his father, Johnny Blaze was adopted by Crash Simpson. Upon his adoption, Johnny lived with Crash, his wife Mona, and his daughter Roxanne.\n     Johnny and Roxanne became very attached to one another. One day, while Johnny and Roxanne were practicing a motorcycle stunt, the motorcycle caught on fire and was about to explode. Roxanne jumped off the motorcycle; but Johnny continued to ride it in an attempt to prevent the tent they were practicing in from burning to the ground. Mona immediately ran over to see if Johnny was alright. However, as she approached Johnny the motorcycle exploded - putting Mona into the hospital. From her hospital bed, Mona Simpson had one request for Johnny Blaze: that he would never ride in the motorcycle shows ever again. After those words, she passed away - making them the last words she would ever speak in this life.\n     Keeping his promise to Mona, Johnny never rode in a motorcycle show. However he continued to practice and improve his riding, despite the promise he had made. He kept his riding a secret. One day as Johnny was practicing, Roxanne stumbled into the tent where he was. Upon doing so, she discovered that Johnny knew how to ride. While practicing continuously, the Crash Simpson stunt show continued and prospered. Not long after the Crash Simpson Stunt Show had gained in popularity, Crash Simpson discovered that he had cancer and was going to die soon. Johnny felt as though her were not able to bear the loss of another fatherly figure in his life. Therefore, he decided the he would do whatever was needed to save Crash Simpson's life - no matter the cost.\n     Making the dealMaking a pact with the devil who later became to be revealed as the arch-demon Mephisto, Johnny Blaze sold his soul to spare Crash Simpson from the disease that was killing him. The Devil agreed to make the pact on one condition, the condition was the one day he would return to collect his fee for curing Crash of the disease. Lives continued on and know one knew of the pact Johnny had made. Crash Simpson not caring for his life anymore and not knowing of the cure that had ridden the disease from his body, decided to make a giant stunt and jump over twenty-two cars, however when he attempted this, Crash collided into the ground and died.\n     After Johnny Blaze saw Crash die, his world had crumbled down, he did not think that life could get any worse. Just as he thought that the Devil appeared. Johnny began yelling at the Devil and telling him that he double crossed him, the Devil stated that he had cured Crash Simpson's disease and that he wanted to claim his reward. With that statement heard he declared that Johnny Blaze would become his Emissary in the dark hours and in the light he would join him in Hades. The pact was made, by day Johnny Blaze would walk among the living, but by night he became the Ghost Rider.\n     During the day Johnny Blaze performed in his traveling stunt show along with Roxanne Simpson after the death of Crash.Johnny would perform his stunts as the Ghost Rider with the audience all believing it to be some great special effects. However they were not effects they were the curse of the Mephisto, and his evil demons were constantly sent to ambush the Ghost Rider, Johnny Blaze and his loved ones. Coming to the decision that he had put Roxanne through too much torment and suffering Johnny left to allow Roxanne to live a normal life.\n     During this time Johnny Blaze became the stunt man for his friend The Stunt Master on his TV show in Los Angeles. At this time he discovered that he could not only turn into Ghost Rider at night but whenever there was evil around. Whilst in Los Angeles Ghost Rider also joined forces with The Champions of Los Angeles to battle the evil forces in the city. However after a few months of fighting alongside The Champions he discovered he was much too much of a loner to battle with them, so he left The Champions forever.\n     During these years the villain known as Orb would be a Blaze's main villain. Soon after, the demonic half of Ghost Rider was exerting more and more control over his actions and personality and Johnny found dealing with his normal life harder and harder. He later joined the Quentin Carnival to perform his motorcycle stunts with fellow rider Red Fowler. Whilst traveling with the carnival Ghost Rider battled Centurious who managed to stir the memories that Johnny had wanted to forget. It was later revealed by the demon Nightmare that the demon who'd bonded with the soul of Johnny Blaze was called Zarathos.\n     Johnny and Zarathos battled for dominance within Johnny and eventually Roxanne Simpson returned to request the help of the Ghost Rider to battle Centurious once again. In doing this Johnny was able to imprison Centurious and Zarathos within the Crystal of Souls and no longer would Johnny Blaze becomes the Ghost Rider, he was free at last of the Mephisto's curse. He eventually married Roxanne and together they had children, Craig and Emma.\n\nPowers and Abilities:\n     Johnny has a piece of the medallion of power , when the piece is activated it unlocks the power of the Ghost Rider [Zarathos] inside him but with Johnny's mother cast spells to stop him being bond to Noble, so Zarathos was bonded to him instead . This gives the Johnny the ability to transform into a mystic being which appears as a flaming skeleton dressed as a motorcyclist, and provides him with superhuman strength, speed, stamina, and durability. \n     Recently Johnny has gained powers that are similar if not the same as Danny Ketch, but probably his most notable is the use of the Penance Stare  the ability to cause others to experience a level of emotional pain equivalent to that which they have caused others as a result of illegal or immoral activities. When in close combat, he locks eyes with his victim and makes them feel all the pain that person has ever inflicted on anyone in their lifetime. This, of course, has several weaknesses. If high on drugs like cocaine, or if the person is blind, or if he cannot make eye contact due to the victim having more than two eyes, Ghost Rider's Penance Stare cannot function. An attempt to use the Penance Stare on the symbiotic being, Venom, resulted in Ghost Rider being knocked unconscious.\n     As the Ghost Rider, Johnny uses a length of heavy chain approximately 3 feet long which possesses magical properties. For instance, when it is thrown it is able to separate into individual links which behave like shuriken, later reintegrating and returning to the Ghost Rider's hand. The chain can grow in length, is supernaturally strong, and can transform into other weapons such as a spear. He can also spin it fast to be used as a drill.\n     The common theme of the Ghost Rider is When riding their bikes, the vehicles can travel faster than conventional motorcycles and can maneuver impossible feats such as riding straight up a vertical surface or across water.\n     When empowered, the host undergoes a more radical transformation. It changes from a conventional looking motorcycle to one that appears both powerful and high-tech. Along with flaming wheels, the bike includes a shield-like battering ram on the front. Like the Blaze/Zarathos version, this Ghost Rider's bike was capable of incredible stunts, such as driving up sheer walls, across water, and in at least two known instances, through the very air itself. Ghost Rider also created two other bikes that he could utilize in the same manner as the one he normally rode, one out of necessity when Blackheart stole the original in a crossover graphic novel that brought together Ghost Rider, Wolverine, and the Punisher, and again in the regular series as a spare in case something made him unable to get to his regular cycle. The latter would wind up in the hands of Johnny Blaze.\n     After two years in Hell, John had learned a few tricks such as spitting fire and vomiting his chain. He possessed complete control over Hellfire and normal fire, he can generate and project hellfire in massive amounts and manipulate it in anyway he likes, an good example of this is when Danny raises a wall of hellfire. Ghost Rider also had the ability to destroy the undead, and Noble Kale is Marvel's incarnation of the Angel of Death/Judgment, which detailed the supposed origins of the Noble Kale version of the Ghost Rider\n     Blaze and Zarathos often battle for dominance and control over their shared body. Kale had a compassionate side and while there were times that he seemed tempted to simply take over completely, he refused to do so, though he felt anger at condemning Daniel to only being able to live his life out half the time, while he dominated the other half. Kale and Ketch, like Blaze and Zarathos, could sometimes communicate through dreams, and in at least one issue communicated via messages written on a mirror in lipstick.",

                    "     The man called Blade was born in a Soho Brothel, in Great Britain on October 24, 1929. Blade is 72 years old but his vampire powers make him look much younger. Blade's mother, Tara Brooks; a prostitute at Madame Vanity's Brothel, experienced severe labor complications, and a doctor was summoned. The name of the doctor was�Deacon Frost, in reality a bloodthirsty vampire. Frost feasted on Blade's mother during Blade's birth, killing her, and accidentally passing along certain enzymes in his own blood to the infant. This process turned Blade into a Dhampir - one who has been touched, but not converted, by a vampire.\n     This resulted in Blade's superhuman abilities, such as immunity to being turned, ability to smell supernatural creatures, and greatly prolonged lifespan. This also caused Blade's sensitivity to bright light. Frost was driven off by Blade's mother's coworkers before he could kill the infant as well. They raised him until he was nine years old. Though he lacked superhuman physical prowess, he trained himself to become an Olympic-level athlete and formidable hand-to-hand combatant. Most notably, he became an expert with edged weapons and especially knives and daggers. \n     Walking home from school, Blade saw an old man being attacked by three bandits. Blade fought off the hoodlums, who turned out to be vampires, and rescued the old man. He learned that the old man was Jamal Afari, a jazz trumpeter and vampire hunter. Afari moved into Madame Vanity's brothel and trained the young Blade in both music and combat. Blade was soon able to defeat many of the weak, younger vampires that he and Afari found in abundance.He appears in many series defeating many strong vampires and villains.\n\nPowers and Abilities:\n     Due to his mother being bitten by a vampire while pregnant with him, Blade displays unique abilities as a Dhampir. It has been shown, several times, that he is immune to vampire venom and cannot become an actual vampire by normal means. He has all of their abilities and none of their weaknesses. Blade does posses a trait common to all vampires: the thirst for blood. However, rather than consuming blood, he injects a specially designed serum that provides the same nourishment. As a Dhampir, Blade possesses superhuman strength and senses. He is capable of seeing objects with perfect clarity and at a much greater distance than a human or vampire. Blade's hearing is similarly enhanced, allowing him to detect sounds that humans and vampires can not. Dissimilar to vampires, he is immune to sunlight. Blade also possesses a number of other powers and abilities due to training and his vampire-like physiology.\nPseudo-Immortality:Blade possesses a form of immortality. Due to his vampire-like abilities he ages slower than an average human, which has allowed him to have a prolonged lifespan.\nInvulnerability: Due to his vampire-like physiology, Blade is resistant to the hypnotic gaze of vampires (known as mesmerism) and highly resistant to other psychic and physical attacks.\nHealing Factor: Similar to Wolverine, Blade has a healing factor that allows him to recover from injuries at alarming rates. His immune system attacks alien substances (chemicals/viruses) and eliminates any chance of him being rendered helpless or maimed from toxicity or infection. The full extent of Blade's regenerative abilities are unknown, but after being bitten by Morbius, he is able to regenerate missing/damaged limbs, tissue, organs, and muscles.\nDanger Sense:Blade has a very rare ability to sense supernatural phenomenon (which vampires do not seem to possess). This has helped him many times at identifying demons, even if they have taken possession of a human being (this is noticeable when a demon possessed a man, Blade sensed the demonic essence coming from him). Blade can sense nearing danger, allowing him to quickly react to incoming threats\nSuperhuman Agility:Blade's agility, balance and bodily coordination are enhanced to levels that are beyond the natural physical limits of a human being. His agility is also greater then that possessed by most vampires.\nHypnosis: Blade has displayed the ability to hypnotize his opponents. He can directly influence the minds of others. He's showcased this ability when he caused Tyrone Cash to revert to from his Hulk-like level, to his human form.\nMaster Martial Artist:Blade is Master Martial Artist, proficient in practically every known weaponry and martial art known to man. Blade can easily hold his own against multiple enemies, and can adapt to any fighting style (unarmed or armed).\nEspionage:Due to being a vampire-like being, Blade can not be captured on film, camera, or be seen in a mirror. His superhuman agility and advanced speed allows him to infiltrate compounds almost undetected.\nIntellect:Blade has shown that he has vast knowledge pertaining to supernatural phenomenon, gained by his experiences and decades of living. He has an understanding of the supernatural realm. He no longer thinks of himself as just a vampire slayer, but a demonic reaper. He will do anything necessary to protect what he believes in.",

                    "     Early in The Matrix, Neo learns that his life as he knows it has been an illusion, a computer-generated world beyond anything even his own computer-hacker sensibilities can comprehend. He gets over his shock swiftly and undertakes the task of liberating others from the virtual fate that's been forced on them. Neo's path to enlightenment is quick and smooth. He is sought out by those who already understand the truth and given the choice to learn the truth or return to a life of falsity. He chooses the red pill the choice that opens his eyes and changes his direction from lazy hacker to hero of the universe. Neo never shows much emotion, and we get a sense of his growing self-confidence mainly by watching his increasingly shocking and skillful fighting moves.\n     Soft-spoken and reclusive, Neo is initially confused when he is torn out of the Matrix by strangers. Morpheus and his followers look up to Neo, thrust major responsibility onto him, and seem to know all about him, but he has little idea why he has been chosen as the object of their admiration. As the trilogy progresses, Neo becomes more sure of himself as he accepts and nurtures his newfound abilities. Neo is a unique kind of superman: healthy, but not overmuscled; strong, but not especially masculine. He assumes responsibility but gives no lectures on moral goodness, and he doesn't shy away from violence when it's necessary. His character develops gradually from passivity toward action, until he finally initiates conflict in order to bring about resolution.\n\nPowers and abilities:\n     Neo has carried, since his inception, the Matrix's source code known as the Prime Program. This gives him the ability to freely manipulate the simulated reality of the Matrix, similar to the authority a system administrator has over a given system. He manifests these abilities as various superhuman powers.\n     The power Neo exhibits most often is telekinesis. In that, he seems capable of manipulating any object in the Matrix through will alone. By focusing this ability upon himself, he can fly at amazing speeds and jump great distances.  His speed of flight is further exemplified by his ability to escape explosions, and the sonic boom left in his wake has the power to overturn rows of heavy vehicles. He has used this ability multiple times to stop several bullets in mid flight, first against the Agents and again against the Merovingian.\n     In addition to his abilities, Neo possesses superhuman strength and agility, and is near-invulnerable to most attacks. Although he could block a sword with the edge of his hand, he received a small cut, indicating that he was still human despite his powers. His endurance is also finite: when confronted by masses of Smith clones in the second film, Neo was forced to escape rather than continue fighting. His reflexes are great enough to dodge bullets.\n     Neo was able to revive the recently deceased Trinity by gently applying pressure on the heart, and thus making it operational once again. Though the extent and limits of his ability to revive within the Matrix are not known.\n     A more subtle application of Neo's ability is a heightened awareness of the simulated nature of the Matrix, enabling him to easily detect Agents, Exiles, and other anomalous phenomena (such as the presence of explosives). He is even capable of a limited form of precognition. This has been described as seeing the world without time by the Oracle.\n     Neo (like most Red Pills) utilizes the Resistance's combat programs, which grant combat abilities equivalent to a martial artist with decades of experience. Neo is able to run an unprecedented number of these programs simultaneously; he is therefore a master of multiple martial arts and fighting styles, including kung fu, kempo, judo, savate, jujitsu, karate, eskrima, zui quan, andtaekwondo. \n     In the real world, Neo does not display any of the aforementioned abilities aside from fighting skills. Neo does have some degree of wireless connectivity with the Matrix system: he eventually learns to sense the presence of the Machines, and even interfere with their function. This capability overwhelms him at first after he disables a squad of sentinels, causing him to collapse and sends him to limbo without the equipment normally used by the Resistance due to him still being inexperienced with his powers. According to the Oracle, The power of The One extends beyond the Matrix. It reaches from here all the way back to where it came from. Apparently because of his status as The One, he has a direct connection to the Source, and can therefore affect everything connected to it. After he is blinded in the fight against Smith/Bane, Neo begins to perceive everything connected to the Source, including the Machine City itself, as silhouettes of golden light.",

                    "     Norrin Radd lived on the peaceful planet Zenn-La (Deneb System, Milky Way Galaxy). Utilizing scientific discovery and advancement, the Zenn-Lavians effectively eliminated the plagues commonly associated with Earth: hunger, disease, crime and war, effectively creating a Utopian society. Norrin's parents were Jartran and Elmar Radd. Jartran was a scientist and Norrin followed in his footsteps, constantly studying. Unable to cope with what Zenn-La had become, a society that had devolved into hedonism, essentially becoming directionless, Norrin's mother Elmar committed suicide when he was very young. Nevertheless, Norrin always blamed himself for this. Norrin was nurtured by his father to become a great man. After he entered manhood his father was implicated in the theft of another scientist's ideas. When Norrin confronted his father he admitted negligence. Disgusted by his father's actions, Norrin withdrew from him. Evidently depressed by his indiscretion, which was made public by the local media and the evident lack of support by his son, Jartran committed suicide.\n     Like his mother and father, Norrin also dreamed of a society that had more substance. He believed that no goals were left to be achieved on Zenn-La. He was filled with discontent and often went to the museum to watch holograms of Zenn-La's past, such as wars and space travel. This often troubled his girlfriend, Shalla Bal. She believed they had all they could ever want together, but Norrin always dreamed of more.\n     One day their peaceful existence was threatened by the presence of Galactus, the Devourer of Worlds, who subsists on the energies provided by entire planets. The Council of Scientists let Norrin use a spaceship to approach Galactus and plead for the sake of the planet. Galactus agreed to spare the planet in exchange for Norrin to become one of the Heralds of Galactus. Given a fraction of the Power Cosmic, and based on a childhood fantasy of his, Galactus transformed Norrin into the Silver Surfer. The Silver Surfer's main task was to find planets with the proper energy Galactus needed to feed on. Over time it became more difficult to find planets without life on them. Knowing Norrin Radd would resist taking a life, Galactus deliberately altered Norrin's mind to repress his morals, allowing Norrin Radd to more efficiently carry out his grim task of finding suitable planets to feed on. A decidedly introspective character plagued by the sins of his past, Norrin Radd forever seeks redemption, endeavoring to carry out justice throughout the universe.\n     Radd serves Galactus for an unspecified amount of time.\n     Eventually, the Surfer summons his master to Earth. Here the Surfer meets the Fantastic Fourand Alicia Masters. Touched by their nobility, he rebels against Galactus, who is eventually driven off. Before he leaves, he confines the Surfer to Earth with an invisible barrier that affects only him.\n     During his exile, the Surfer fights numerous villains, including Doctor Doom, who wants his Power Cosmic, and Mephisto, who wants his soul. The Surfer's only ally during these trials is a physicist by the name of Al B. Harper, who eventually sacrifices himself to save the world from the Stranger.\n     Banding together with the Hulk and Namor the Sub-Mariner during these wanderings, the Surfer forms the Titans Three, a group dedicated to battling evil on Earth.Soon, Doctor Strange joins the group and it becomes The Defenders. Surfer stays with them for a while, but his overwhelming desire to be free of Earth and his frequent collisions with Galactus' energy-draining barrier eventually drives him to leave the group.\n     The Surfer finally pierces Galactus' barrier with the aid of Reed Richards and temporarily escapes Earth. He discovers, though, that his homeworld has been ravaged by Galactus and Shalla-Bal has been abducted by Mephisto and taken to Earth. Even though it means trapping himself once more, the Surfer returns to Earth to battle and defeat Mephisto. \n     After the Surfer aids the Fantastic Four against Galactus' latest herald, Terrax, Surfer finally manages to pierce Galactus' barrier by acting on the Thing's suggestion of trying to pass through on a spaceship instead of via his own power on his surfboard. He also manages to make peace with Galactus, after which Galactus finally declares the Surfer's long exile ended.\n     The Surfer repeatedly battles space-born menaces, the chief of whom is Thanos, who attempts to kill half the life in the universe using the omnipotent Infinity Gauntlet. Through Thanos, the Surfer learns how Galactus had altered his soul. He convinces Galactus to restore it, but once Galactus has done so, the Surfer is overcome with grief until he is able to forgive himself. \n     The Surfer returns home to Zenn-La to find that the planet has vanished, and learns it was actually destroyed in the 1940s (Earth time) by the entity known as the Other. Zenn-La and its people which the Surfer repeatedly encountered since leaving Galactus' service were actually reproductions, created by Galactus so that the Surfer would have a home to return to. Losing his capacity for emotion again, the Surfer returns to Earth. \n     Later, the Surfer works with the alien Annunaki race to gather and protect some of Earth's most extraordinarily gifted children. After many adventures Surfer resumes his interstellar wanderings, but promises to be ready to aid his adopted homeworld should Earth ever need him.\n     During his travels, the Surfer is captured by a portal of the Planet Sakaar Empire. Left weakened and vulnerable by his trip through the portal, the Surfer is subdued and implanted with an obedience disk to ensure he remains loyal to them. Fighting as a gladiator, the Surfer is finally forced to face the Hulk along with his Warbound. Through teamwork and distraction, the Hulk is eventually able to destroy the Surfer's obedience disk. The Hulk and several other slaves and gladiators are freed when the Surfer uses the Power Cosmic to remove their own obedience disks and give them a way out of the arena, although the Hulk declines the Surfer's offer to take him back to Earth.\n     During the Annihilation war, the Silver Surfer again becomes Galactus' herald to help save the universe from the despot Annihilus. Annihilus captures them and gives them to Thanos for experimentation. Drax the Destroyer frees the Surfer, who in turn frees Galactus. An enraged Galactus destroys more than half the Annihilation Wave, and Annihilus is defeated. Later, the Surfer is joined as herald by Stardust, a former herald the Surfer had replaced.\n     The Surfer leads the world devourer to the populated planet Orbucen, which brings him into conflict with Richard Rider. He delays the planetary destruction to give the inhabitants more time to evacuate.\n     The Silver Surfer returns to Sakaar in a plan to feed Galactus with the unique Old Power which he claims would sate his master's hunger for thousands of years, sparing many other inhabited worlds. He is opposed by the Hulk's son Skaar, and is enslaved by an obedience disc. The conflict is ended when Skaar's mother Caiera sacrifices her soul and Old Power as sustenance for Galactus.Unfortunately, Galactus now seems addicted to the Old Power and has begun searching for other planets containin it to sate himself.\n     After an encounter with the High Evolutionary, the Silver Surfer and Galactus battled Thor and the Asgardians. The battle ended when the Silver Surfer chose to leave his post as herald and guard an Asgardian artifact. Galactus tethers him to Asgard's location in Oklahoma, resulting in his powers waning the further he travels from Asgard, and grants him the ability to return to human form.\n     During the war with the Serpent, Silver Surfer aids Doctor Strange, Namor, Loa, and Lyra in the liberation of New Atlantis from Attuma (in the form of Nerkodd: Breaker of Oceans). He subsequently aided Loki in 'reactivating' Mjolnir so that it could restore the deceased Thor's memory in time to allow him to return to life.\n\nPowers and abilities:\n     The Silver Surfer wields the Power Cosmic, granting him superhuman strength, endurance, senses and the ability to absorb and manipulate the universe's ambient energy. The Surfer can navigate through interstellar space and hyperspace, which he can enter after exceeding the speed of light. He has proven capable of time travel on several occasions, even able to make others time-travel with him.\n     The Surfer sustains himself by converting matter into energy; does not require food, water, air, or sleep (although he occasionally enters a sleep-like meditation in order to dream); and can survive within nearly any known natural environment, including deep space, hyperspace, and even within black holes and stars. The Surfer can project energy in various forms for offensive and defensive use, including bolts of cosmic force powerful enough to destroy entire planets, and create black holes.He can utilize the Power Cosmic to augment his superhuman strength to indeterminate levels. The Surfer can heal living organisms, though he cannot raise the dead,and he has proven capable of revitalizing and evolving organic life on a planet-wide scale. He can cast illusions, create interdimensional portals to other locations including microverses, phase through solid matter,and exercise some level of control over the Astral Plane.\n     His senses enable him to detect objects and concentrations of energy light years away and to perceive matter and energy in subatomic detail, including life energies of living beings. The Surfer can even see through time, and with concentration he can achieve limited perception of past and future events in his general vicinity. He has demonstrated telepathic ability, including mind-reading on occasion, and has proven to be able to influence human emotion and sensation.\n     The Surfer's board is composed of a nearly impervious, cosmically powered silvery material that is similar to his own skin. The board is mentally linked to the Surfer and moves in response to his mental commands even when he is not in physical contact with it. The board is nearly indestructible, but on those rare occasions when it has been damaged or destroyed, the Surfer has proven able to repair it, or even recreate it, with little effort. The Surfer can attack opponents remotely by directing the board against them, and the board is capable of absorbing and imprisoning other beings, at least temporarily.\n     When Galactus exiled the Surfer to Earth, his means of imprisonment was linked to the board. When the Surfer and the Fantastic Four realized this, the Surfer put it to the test by leaving the board planet-side and entering space in the Four's spacecraft. Once he was free of Earth, the Surfer remotely converted the board to energy, recalled it to him, and reformed it in space.\n     Norrin Radd also possesses some knowledge of the advanced alien technology of the planet Zenn-La.",
